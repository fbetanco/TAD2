Michigan had a dump of 470,000 votes at 4am compared to Trumps 3,200. This completely flipped the state. In fact, WI, AZ, NV, PA, and GA all stopped counting at 4am which Trump was crushing Biden in. This was an unprecedented move never seen in election history, where states that peddled Biden across the finish line all took weeks to meticulously craft his victory.

The inconsistencies from Obama, to Clinton, to Biden do not add up at all. Biden somehow garnered the most votes in US history, while losing 44% more collective counties across America than Obama did and tallying 14 million more votes. Hillary won about the same amount of counties, but she tallied 17 million less votes. Nothing seems valid at all in how this went down.

We can also look at the aformentioned states I mentioned where voting mysteriously stopped at 4am. Take Pennsylvania for example: Trump was leading 57% to 41% with almost 60 percent of the state accounted for. For Biden to flip that state, the remaining vote tallies would have to be more left leaning than the most liberal of all places, such as San Francisco. As you saw, that is precisely what happened, as it did in the other stolen states.","3_2_2_1_1"

[There was a jump in votes for Biden in Michigan of approximately 200,000 around 6:00 a.m. EST as shown in the FiveThirtyEight election blog update at 8:27 a.m. EST on Nov. 4 ( here ), which explains that this was due to a tranche of new votes from Wayne County, home to Detroit, where Biden led Trump at the time 67% to 32%.](https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-factcheck-wi-pa-mi-vote-spikes/fact-check-vote-spikes-in-wisconsin-michigan-and-pennsylvania-do-not-prove-election-fraud-idUSKBN27Q307)


You all wanted votes to be counted in secure and exact locations. In many states like Arizona and Michigan this meant transporting votes to said locations. This fucking takes time. So once votes from particular counties arrive to counting locations, they then begin counting and you see these spikes. This literally accounts for every single one of your fraud allegations. 

[Article 2.](https://www.eipartnership.net/blog/potentially-misleading-data-visualizations-lindell)

[Article 3.](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/why-does-it-take-so-long-count-mail-ballots-key-states-blame-legislatures) these two articles mainly talk about how Republican fear-mongering and discouraging mail-in voting means many mail-ins are blue votes. This then compounds with strict signature verification methods that lead to democrats pulling out a late lead in states like Michigan, Wisconsin and PA with stricter signature verification methods. Literally them having stricter verification methods to avoid fake ballots is interpreted as elections being stolen by you people.

Do you have any other compromised Leftist articles that convince you that shutting down the votes at 4am, coupled with a massive dump of votes is organic? I bet you have lots. I reject every last one of them - how about that?

Nothing you can provide to me can explain what happened. No matter how finely worded it is under the guise of a Leftist news rag, it will not change anything. The anomalies that occurred cannot be justified, even through ""mail-in ballots"". As I stated - every other state who had the ability to produce mail in ballots were consistent with their voting patterns on the first night. By day 2, those 30 to 40 states were able to figure out if Trump or Biden won (mostly Trump). It was the 6 states that took multiple weeks to ""count ballots"" that changed the outcome of events.

Tens of millions of Americans contested these contentious elections, and over 60 judges dismissed every last one of these cases before a shred of evidence could be presented. It's almost as if stolen states hand selected corrupt judges to peddle the steal! Or, those judges didn't want the same outcome to happen to them like what happened to governor Kemp, when his daughters fiance mysteriously blew up on the highway, and ever since then - Kemp changed tune that the election was fair.","3_2_2_1_1_1_1_1_1"

Anyone who opposes their goals becomes the enemy. They will do anything to take them down.
This new guy who was on the republican debate the other night, I can spell his name. I call him Rams for short. If he won the Presidency, the left would attack him also. 
I never trusted the Bush family period. I think they were involved with this New World Order mess too.
Truly evil people inside that democratic party and finally, folks are seeing that reality. The only other Presidents during my lifetime that were in it for the people were Kennedy and Reagan. That is out of almost 65 years of life. 
That is sad, for over six decades, only three Presidents appealed to me.
Kennedy was hated and we all know what happened to him. Reagan wasn't on everyone's favorite list either and almost taken out but in a different set of circumstances than Kennedy. I hope we never have to travel that road again. It was a sad time in American history when Kennedy was being laid to rest.
Hillary Clinton was suppose to be the left's first female President and their next Obama. 
President Trump destroyed her on election night results in record time. Hell, she was so upset. She was calling the 2016 election results  tainted or crooked. Research it.
Trump will be elected President again. The only thing that will stop it is from a higher power than what walks on this world..

Think about it, the people tend to do what they're told to do by the MSM and politicians. After 9-11 we were told to fear and hate Muslims so people largely feared and hated Muslims. During Obama's administration they were told no, that's racist, don't fear and hate Muslims (even though Obama's admin bombed and droned Muslim countries mercilessly) so people no longer feared and hated Muslims. That's one example but it largely is true on other topics too.

There was plenty of evidence for a competent auditor or any man of integrity to know that the election was uncertifiable.

Secretary of State Brad Raffensbergers office secretly recorded the phone call with President Trump, then lied about it to the far left Washington Post.

Raffenspergers office later ran to the Washington Post and leaked a fraudulent transcript of the call.

After they were caught lying to the America public, The Washington Post outed Jordan Fuchs as their anonymous source for their garbage hit piece.

Fuchs provided the WaPo with a fraudulent Trump quote that the paper ran in an anti-Trump hit piece on January 9th.
They planned this to do the most damage to President Trump before the sham impeachment trial in the US Senate.

Georgia Chairman of the Republican Party David Shafer later revealed that Raffensperger and Fuchs lied to the Washington Post about Trump demanding that they find the fraud.

Former diplomat Terje Rød-Larsen
Edmond de Rothschild Group chairwoman Ariane de Rothschild

Bensons guidelines focused on signature verification of absentee ballot applications and their return envelopes, which were to be compared against each other as well as against signatures in qualified voter files.

Bensons office said that signature review begins with the presumption that the signature on an absent voter ballot application or envelope is valid, Murray wrote. The Secretary of States instructions to clerks further said signatures with any redeeming qualities -- described as those having similar distinctive flourishes

This rule that I apparently dont understand that you refuse to state& it literally is just a secondary check for signature verification.

On the surface, its bad to have so many indictments. However, if you look at how the law has been skirted for one political party vs the other (do I even need to go into detail on Hunter, Hilary, etc.?) - people are infuriated. Justice should be blind, but in this case these people use lawfare to try and take out the leading opposition candidate to the president?

As for the actual indictments - happy to explore why they are all major stretches, and examples of how prosecutorial discretion is not being practiced. Take the NY one for instance - they used a newly made up legal theory to stretch the misdemeanor of wrongfully classified business expenses to be a felony by claiming it violated campaign finance law. The organization that oversees these violations actually looked at the payments and deemed them not in violation. Take the classified records case - those records were legally retained according to the presidential records act. Take Georgia - anyone is legally allowed to challenge the results of an election per the electoral count act of 1887. Why hasnt Hilary or Stacey Abrams been indicted for complaining their elections were stolen, despite zero evidence supporting it? 

Not to mention, the timing of these indictments is incredibly suspect - why did it take over two years to charge him with crimes related to January 6th? Why do these indictments drop, every single time, right after some bad news about the Bidens come out?

The first impeachment of Trump started because he asked Ukraine to provide information on the Biden's likely corruption in Ukraine - Biden himself is on video bragging about the actual quid pro quo he strong armed them with! 

I'm sure you'll ignore/spin all of this, but it is amusing to see people who swallow every lie from people who, after enough time, are always proven wrong - and justify this lawfare campaign against Trump while shrugging off the mountains of evidence on the other side that is completely ignored.","2_3_4"

I did, many years ago.  I thought to myself, ""Christ Almighty this guy won't stop running his mouth and talking so much inflammatory rhetoric..."" but then I saw what he DID.  I saw how he behaved one-on-one and read several books from multiple angles.  They all had a common theme, which I just mentioned:  he's a loudmouth schnook, but he gets shit done.

...tells us that, in general, conservatives are more knowledgeable on policies *from both major perspectives*, i.e., conservatives study the issues from more angles and it can be inferred that conservatives understand where liberal Democrats are coming from.

So when your leftist sheep friends say something to the effect of ""ReAd ThE iNDiCtMeNt!"", odds are, conservatives have, therefore Trump supporters have, they vehemently disagree with them, and see them for what they really are.

The real issue to my mind was that someone in Washington needed to engage VP Biden quietly and say that his son Hunters presence on the Burisma board undercut the anti-corruption message the VP and we were advancing in Ukraine b/c Ukrainians heard one message from us and then saw another set of behavior with the family association with a known corrupt figure whose company was known for not playing by the rules, embassy official George Kent wrote to Yovanovitch in the Nov. 22, 2016, email marked confidential.

Joe Bidens role in pressuring then-Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko in December 2015 to fire Shokin has been a searing controversy since April 2019, when the lead author on this story, as a columnist for The Hill, unearthed a 2018 videotape of the former vice president bragging about his role to a foreign policy think tank.

The Senate then acts as courtroom, jury and judge, except in presidential impeachment trials, during which the chief justice of the U.S. Supreme Court acts as judge.

A two-thirds majority of the Senate is required to convict. If a president is acquitted by the Senate, the impeachment trial is over. But if he or she is found guilty, the Senate trial moves to the sentencing or punishment phase.

The point you seem if not get is all politicians should be treated the same under the law.  If saying an elections was rigged is a crime then  Stacey Abrams,  Hillary Clinton, AL Gore, and and wack of congress people should be indicted. 

 Remember ""no one is above the law"" should be the rule of law, but it isn't as Hunter's plea deal, Russia  hoax,  Haiti Clinton foundation donations, etc etc all demonstrate the establishment are exempt from prosecution.  

This should concern Americans, but it is now a way to win political advantsge even if it its illegal.

To be totally honest with you, I thought you were being sarcastic and I was agreeing with you. 

When candidates run on the idea of draining the swamp, it is a complete joke. The difference between Trump and other candidates, however, is that:

- Although he was illegally surveilled (amongst other things), he initially kept the FBI director who not only oversaw the illegal surveillance, but let Hillary off the hook.
- After eventually firing Comey, he hired a new FBI director. This *new* director was in possession of the Hunter Biden laptop, for *at least* a year prior to the subsequent election.
- Even though the laptop is in the hands of the DOJ, a widely-accepted false narrative that it was misinformation was able to be peddled.

The response I sometimes hear is, ""Well, he's *really* mad now! I think he learned something and will *actually* drain the swamp this time!""

No, he won't. And firing a head of a department is not ""draining the swamp.""

I don't want someone for President who *might* learn how to offensively wield the DOJ.  Trump cycled thru multiple AGs and FBI directors.

He got kicked in the face 49 times, and the Trump base believes 50 times to be the lucky number. Good luck with that.

His opponent has severe dementia (at best), yet runs a DOJ that can initiate multiple indictments against him.

Hopefully, we get a winning candidate that can run things as effectively. 

I'm afraid we will not, however, given the extent to which his base is impressed by the Trump WWF persecution miniseries ... I mean, his indictments (primarily a consequence of him running his mouth at the wrong times, regardless of what you think of his innocence/guilt).

It's actually in Trump's best interest to lose the nomination, because he is guaranteed to not win the general election. Independents and undecideds make the winner - always - and unfortunately for Trump, *there is not a single remaining independent/undecided voter whose mind is not made up on Trump*.

At least another GOP nominee would have a chance to pardon him.

The results of prior elections do not indicate he has widened his appeal to independents/undecideds. They show the opposite.

Consider Grover Cleveland - the only President to have ever been elected to non-consecutive terms:

- 1884: Won the Popular vote 
- 1888: Won the Popular vote (but lost)
- 1892: Won the Popular vote

Here's Trump:

- 2016: LOST the Popular vote
- 2020: LOST the Popular vote
- 2024: 3rd time's a charm???

Trump's nomination will give us a second Biden term (or whoever it is), and if a jury in *any one of his trials* agrees with former *Trump* AG William Barr's assessment, on *even a fraction of the charges*, he will end up doing some time.

Thinking he is innocent will not change any of the math on this, and high primary polls will not translate into the general election when the candidate is as polarizing as Trump is.

I hope the GOP comes to its senses.","4_1_3_1_1"

The interest in him that drives his GOP primary poll numbers to the 50 - 60% level is based on something like personality.

Trump only has that with his base. If you are an independent or undecided voter, you will not be impressed with the same thing.

What are you more likely to hear from an independent:

- &gt;""I don't really know anything about him. I want to hear more about what he thinks about X, Y and Z.""

Or

- &gt;""He's out of the question. My dad/grandmother/friend died during COVID while he made jokes and didn't lead on wearing masks.""
- &gt;""I don't like Biden and voted for Trump the first time, but I just can't vote for him after January 6th.""
- &gt;""If he has *that many* indictments, he probably did something. And everytime he says he won in 2020, I just think, 'Let it go!' I want a Republican, but not him.""
- &gt;""I live in one of those blue states he won in 2016. I voted for him the first time, because I hated Hillary. But when COVID happened, my family's restaurant we ran for 50 years got shut down in the lockdowns, and we lost everything. Those stimulus checks helped some people, but we lost everything.""

We can agree that some of what is alleged in those statements may not be correct, but there are actual people out there that voted for him who think things like that. Droves of them. 

And he totally lost them after 2020. That is reflected in the declining popular vote. They have been completely amputated from the population of independents. And as independents, they do not see him as a martyr. 

Everyone who is high on seeing him fight these indictments is in a totally different world from independents. They're not the majority, but they are the king makers in the general.

I'll have faith in GOP voter intelligence when they get off the crack, look around and realize that he is already a known quantity to the entire voting public. 

There is nothing new about him, as everyone has already come to a conclusion that wilp not change. You cannot go thru the unique series of society upheavals our country went thru while he was President (either because of him or not), and still not have your mind made up. 

Again:
*Independents and undecideds make the winner.*

We need someone who *maximizes* the margin of undecided voters. Donald Trump *minimizes* it. Unfortunately, his skill at rallying his base is going to trap us in a stillborn general election. I hope some people figure this out before it's too late.

It's not the most satisfying ego trip for him to drop out (he won't) or lose the nomination, but what I am saying is that it's also the best path for him to stay out of prison.","4_1_3_1_1_1_1"

They are so racist that they love it when black children are surrounded by criminals and violence. To the mods of that JusticeServed sub, keeping impoverished minorities safe is opposite of their agenda which is to completely destroy minority communities, so they can take over the neighborhoods and turn them all into yuppyvilles like they have already done in California. 

If you actually look at their posts, they are pro-minority criminals. That means they encourage minorities to commit crimes against other minorities and in minority communities. They are pro-abortion, pro-abortion clinics, and encourage clinics in minority communities. To them, even those that protest the clinics are the enemy. They are anti-cop, pro-illegal immigrants, pro-human trafficking, and pro-drugs. 

To them, we are the enemy, because we are law-abiding patriotic citizens that want law or order even for minority communities. We want to offer support and hope rather than throw the impoverished at abortion clinics, and we're for protecting minority children rather than working hard like the liberals do to completely destroy their childhoods. 

So yeah, just be happy to be done with that sub and the other Nazi controlled liberal subs on this platform. You're much better off.","3"

It was confirmed in court that the FBI was behind the document and and FBI operative was the author of the document.

The mysterious document was sent unsolicited to Proud Boy Chairman Enrique Tarrios Telegram right before January 6th by a love interest named Erika Flores.

Flores reportedly testified to the January 6th Committee that A GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL was the author of the entirety of the 1776 Returns and that this FBI and CIA member or associate asked her to share it with Tarrio!

Tarrio was charged with Seditious Conspiracy and was later found guilty along with four fellow members of the Proud Boys. Enrique Tarrio was sentenced to 22 years in federal prison for planning the entire seditious conspiracy. We now know that it was the FBI who was behind the conspiracy.

According to the Motion by attorney Roger Roots:

It appears that the government itself is the author of the most incriminating and damning document in this case, which was mysteriously sent at government request to Proud Boy leader Enrique Tarrio immediately prior to January 6 in order to frame or implicate Tarrio in a government- created scheme to storm buildings around the Capitol. As such, Exhibit 528-1 and the governments efforts to frame or smear defendants with it, constitutes outrageous government conduct. This is either entrapment or outrageous government conduct, or both. Equally improper, it is a Brady violation because the Department of Justice must surely have known these revelations before putting Special Agent Dubrowski on the stand on February 9 to introduce this evidence.","2"

Spiritual Message to all Spiritual leaders and their followers. All Spiritual leaders need to do a prayer asking God and Jesus to help guide us and all life God created through the darkness that is here and guide us into Gods truth and light. Once the Spiritual leaders have dedicated themselves to God and Jesus then ask your followers to do their dedication to God and Jesus and guide then through the darkness into Gods light and truth. Important that Spiritual leaders lead by example before asking others to do the same. Thank you for all your prayers as we will be guided from the darkness into the light and truth.  Knight and I will be doing this rededication prayer today at 1259 PM east coast time.  And please do the rededication prayer  today or as soon as you receive this message. Important we all rededicate ourselves to God and Jesus during these troubled times. Thank you all and know we love all of you.

This country is amazing, and no nation or culture in all of history has done more to empower, enrich, and protect individual citizens than the USA.  Sure, many corrupt politicians have conned their way into positions of authority and abused the powers we invest in them, but in general, Americans and our culture have benifetted both ourselves and the world.  

DC has become an enemy to its citizens.  Our great cities are now cesspools of filth and corruption.  Our economy and industry are being drained for the enrichment of privileged narcissists and sociopaths.  Someone needs to stand up to that, someone we can rally around.  For POTUS... Trump 2024.  There isn't anybody else running worth voting for.

Trump is a patriot who understands what we aspire to be, and like most of us, recognizes the enormous corrupt parasites now flourishing in the halls of our governments, enacting destructive policy designed to empower and protect them at the cost to the freedom, security, and prosperity of most hard working citizens.  He, like us, sees and recognizes the toxic poisonous propaganda being force fed to us on the news, in our schools and universities, and within our businesses and corperations.  He sees it and choose to stand up and take the heat trying to reverse the course those ignorant, corrupt, and incompetant liars have set us on.  He's stayed true to the principles of our great culture, even at great personal risk and loss.  He didn't have to, he was famous, lauded, and set for life... he did it cause it was right to do.  As long as that remains true... I'll support him till the end.","19"

McClain brought the fireas she broke down the evidence their committee collected on Joe and Hunter Bidens dirty dealings with a corrupt Romanian oligarch while Joe Biden was Barack Obamas vice president.

The fiery US Rep explained, I want to talk about the damning evidence of Joe Bidens role in his familys business schemes in Romania. While Joe Biden was vice president, he was directly involved in the United States policy and anticorruption efforts in Romania. Thats a fact!

McClain continued, On May 21, 2014, the then-Vice President Biden delivered an anticorruption speech in Romania. Right? On September 28, 2015, the  Romanian president visited with then-Vice President Biden at the White House to discuss anticorruption efforts. She explained, Gabriel Popoviciu, a corrupt Romanian oligarch in the subject of a criminal probehes the subject of a criminal probe and prosecution for corruption and bribery in Romania. This committee has reviewed transactions showing that the Biden family received money from a foreign company run by this Russian oligarch corrupt Gabriel Popoviciu.

Five weeks after the Romanian president visited with by Vice President Biden, Popoviciu begins paying Hunter Biden and his associates Rob Walker through his company, Bladon Enterprises. The money from Bladen Enterprises is deposited directly into Robinson Walker LLC. Now, this LLC is directly operated by Hunters known business partner, Rob Walker.  Rep McClain explained that she is only relaying facts that the committee has discovered in their investigation into the Biden Crime Family. In November 2015, and again in March. 2016, Hunter Biden, who is not registered as a foreign agent under FARA, meets with the US ambassador to Romania. Red flag! McClain states. Then coincidentally over $1 million flows to the Bidens, McClain said, adding,  Im not much for coincidences; I dont think the American people are either.

Lets run through the numbers together, McClain told the committee members. Between November 2015 and May 2017, Bladon Enterprises deposited over $3 million into Robinson Walkers LLC business account. But then, the Biden family accounts received more than $1 million from Robinson Walkers accounts after these deposits were made. Ironically, 16 of those 17 payments occurred while Joe Biden was vice president. Now, I think most Americans would find it suspicious that, ironically, these payments ended shortly after Joe Biden left office. Another coincidence.","1"

First of all: Trudeau did not apologize for himself, but on behalf of Canadas Parliament.

The FBI and IRS investigated criminal campaign violations involving Joe Bidens 2020 presidential campaign and a politically connected lawyer who paid Hunter Bidens large tax debts.

However, according to congressional investigators, federal prosecutors inside US Attorney Dave Weisss office blocked agents from pursuing the campaign finance violation case.

IRS whistleblower Gary Shapley detailed how Lesley Wolf, a top prosecutor in Weisss office, blocked the investigation into Bidens criminal campaign violations in a case summary memo dated May 3, 2021.
