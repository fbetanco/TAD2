Haley is pure class, a modern William Buckley but without any latent racism percolating deep down, which however much we respect him the man did have. The fact that she wants to make the effort to distinguish Gazans that are decent people that deserve to have the chance at a new life speaks to her being the most mature, humane, rational, and moral candidate. And she can walk and chew gum - at the same time being the most pro-Israel has the right to defend herself and deserves our support candidate historically.

The Buckley standard: the most right, viable candidate who could win ... what donors and party Poobah's need to realize is the national electorate has fundamentally shifted. W. got in by the skin of his teeth, and then coasted on post 9/11 neocon leanings of the country. Obama handily defeated McCain and Romney. I would argue Trump only won because of how despised the corrupt Hilary Clinton is. And then of course he lost against a non-Hilary candidate.

Haley is firmly planted on the right where people care about in the current landscape: defense, fiscal conservatism, and in many ways federalism/libertarianism. Her whole - tell the truth to the American people about abortion and not having the votes for federal legislation is going to make her deeply palatable to huge swaths of the country DeSantis could never dream of wooing.

She's the right candidate for right now, and DeSantis would make a great VP if he's interested.","1_1"

Here's the language: 

Section 3  
No person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress, or elector of President and Vice-President, or hold any office, civil or military, under the United States, or under any State, who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or as an officer of the United States, or as a member of any State legislature, or as an executive or judicial officer of any State, to support the Constitution of the United States, **shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof**. But Congress may by a vote of two-thirds of each House, remove such disability.

They need to hire a team of legal experts to analyze: does this language require a conviction? Or could election officials in blue and purple states simply say they have a good faith belief he engaged in insurrection, rebellion, and gave aid and comfort to enemies of the state, and thus they are not allowing him on the ballot or if he is on the ballot not certifying positive results for him because of a bar from the 14th amendment Section 3 clause.

Your last two sentences are ad hominems that i'm not even sure how to respond to, since the current D.C establishment even in the GOP has led us into useless wars (Afghanistan, Iraq, Ukraine etc.) to no end, and politicians like Nikki Haley support these wars if only to make money off of them (remember Nikki owns hundreds of thousands in Boeing stock).

And then even if she somehow manages to do all that, she still has to beat Trump who has 40% of the party locked down permanently and and another 20% leaning towards him but still up for grabs.

It frustrates me to no end the way Trump has taken over the Republican party and radical authoritarian leftists have taken over the Democratic party, I just want things to return back to normal.

As for not eating meat, its because its in our natural diet. Do you know why humans have dental problems? Its because when farming started the diversity of food in our diets dropped drastically. As hunter gatherers we ate everything we could find. Farming made it so everyone ate similar meals everyday. That caused our jaws to shrink, giving us dental problems. Our immune systems also got weaker from this, along with a myriad of other problems. A further reduction in the diversity of our diets will only cause further damage to the human body over the course of the next few hundred years.

She has so much upside right now. If she wins NH it will scare the shit out of the Dems because Harris is an albotross along with Biden's age. If she goes into Super Tuesday with a win in NH she could run the table. I know this is wishful thinking but NH for Nikki is key right now.

Christie and Hutchison likely killed what little chance they had of winning this primary by saying that. I truly believe that she wouldnt be running if she supported Trump in any way and I wish that candidates didnt have to act this way to win, but unfortunately that is the current state of politics.

Give her a chance. She really is the best bet for the country right now. I get not liking the fact she agreed to support him, but think about all of the upsides. 

She actually acknowledges that climate change is real unlike many of the other candidates. She also realizes that many of the ways democrats are and are trying to go about combating climate change are flawed, and wants to combat it in more effective ways.

Her focus on abortion is to pass the laws that we all agree on, because she is realistic. While she wants to save as many unborn children as possible, she understands that she doesnt have the votes to pass stuff that we dont all agree on. So even if you are pro choice, she isnt going to try to pass anything radical, shes only going to pass stuff that she can realistically get democrats to agree to as well.

She would be the first woman president. She would also be the second minority president and the first Indian American president. Most importantly, shes young. She would be bringing a vastly different perspective to the Presidency than all of the old white guys weve had forever. Shes not stuck in these old ways and actually understands what the country is today. We dont have to worry about her taking a bad fall or having a heart attack or falling asleep in important meetings with world leaders. 

She has experience in both foreign and domestic policy. She has proven she is not only a capable head of state as governor of South Carolina, but she proved to be a god damn good one at. Then when she was at the UN, she didnt take shit from nobody. The US will not be a pushover with her as the commander in chief. 

She would bring respect back to the office. Trump was an oaf. Biden is barely alive. For the first time in 8 years we would actually have someone in the office who is respectful *and* capable of making decisions. We wouldnt be laughed at by other countries for our leadership.

She has the best chance of beating Biden. Desantis is already *hated* by the left for his governing in Florida. Ramaswami is Trump 2.0. Trump is& Trump. Everyone else, other than Tim Scott, are more old White Guys. Seriously, who wants the former Arkansas governor to win? Dude looks ancient. Nikki Hailey is young, a woman, of Indian descent, hasnt done anything to severely piss people on the left off, and is just generally a likable candidate.

TL;DR: She is the only way. Please reconsider your support for her.","1_1_1"

However, many in the Democratic Party (and, seemingly, the global Left in general) have seemed to misrepresent climate change as a moral issue instead of a scientific one.
There appears to be a fundamental predisposition/subconscious association by many of the most vocal on the Left that human activity/production == Business == bad (in all ways), and so upon greater evidence of climate change being caused by CO2 (and a swath of other toxic, potentially worse compounds) emissions, their instinctual reaction is to stop the evil production/work..
If enacted via policy in only part of the world (Western &amp; Westernized democracies), this would likely not solve the problem, but redirect todays emissions to come from more disinterested regimes (like China), and have the added blow of worsening our economies, through a loss of relative output (some of this is already happening).
However, governmental and societal focus of human ingenuity to solve big problems (like putting a man on the moon, sending the first satellite to Mars orbit, developing a viable vaccine for a myriad different diseases that have plagued us through history) has generally been successful. And none of the above should be perceived to imply that we should allow large scale polluters to continue wrecking our environmental future with impunity.

The tragedy of the commons is a real thing, and there are ways that people and organizations can extract profits while harming everyone else (whether this is via able-bodied individuals collecting Social Security/public benefits under false or exaggerated pretenses, or if it is via factories spilling toxins in a public lake or carelessly releasing toxic exhaust into the air in order to operate more cheaply).

I like that Nikki has alluded to more practical approaches to fighting harmful climate change through wide scale investment in research and technology. The unfortunate state of our world and the Lefts approach to climate change (simply asking that Western and developed states prevent emissions from within their borders) will likely lead to hopeless and dire outcomes for everyone, especially as China does little to stagnate the rate of pollution from their country, and rapidly industrializing nations (like those in Subsaharan Africa) will undoubtedly race to catch up in economies and population to the rest of the world and become centers of growth in coming decades.
A more rational approach than kicking and screaming at inconsiderate executives of (largely state-sanctioned/state-enabled) oil, coal, gas and utility companies will be needed if we want to achieve something as fundamentally important as protecting the fate of our planet and the species that live on it. We will have to find ways to actively counter and reverse some of the damage that has been and continues to be done, while disincentivizing further pollution. Too often, people who are aware of this issue only focus on one side of the equation.","2_1"

An important point: China has built as much renewable generating capacity as the rest of the world, and it is rapidly building more (see [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/29/china-wind-solar-power-global-renewable-energy-leader](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/29/china-wind-solar-power-global-renewable-energy-leader)).

Biden has set America back. Its time to be bold and creative.

By Nikki Haley June 26, 2023 6:10 pm ET

A few months after I left the United Nations, I gave a speech to the Asian Leadership Conference about communist China. I warned about its growing military power, its aggression and its threat to Americas survival. I urged U.S. leaders to think about China critically, creatively and courageously.

Four years later, they have failed to meet this challenge.

Donald Trump deserves credit for upending the failed bipartisan consensus that trading with China would free China. Yet he was singularly focused on trade, doing too little about the rest of the Chinese threat. Mr. Trump even congratulated the Communist Party on its 70th anniversary of conquering China. He should have condemned it.

Joe Bidens record is much worse. He has refused to investigate seriously Chinas coverup of Covids origins, done little to stop the expansion of Chinas footprint on our homeland, and failed to address Chinas key role in the fentanyl crisis. He has weakened the U.S. military and played into Chinas negotiating hand with his obsessive focus on climate issues.

The Communist Party is preparing China for war. Xi Jinping has said it. America has to stop wasting time. That was true four years ago, when I called on our leaders to act. Its even truer now. Here is my comprehensive plan to confront China:

"" Root out Chinese influence in the U.S. Chinese investors have bought nearly 400,000 acres of American land, much of it near military bases. Ill do everything in my power to prevent China from buying any more land and force it to sell what it already owns. In education, China is giving hundreds of millions of dollars to American universities and seeking research partnerships with military applications. I will push to eliminate federal funding for universities that take Chinese money and ban propaganda centers on campus. The U.S. government should also ban all lobbying from the Communist Party and Chinese companies, which are front groups for the regime.

Then theres fentanyl. Chinese companies make nearly all the precursor chemicals that Mexican cartels turn into this deadly drug. I will push Congress to revoke permanent normal trade relations until the flow of fentanyl ends. If China wants normal trade, it has to stop killing Americans.

"" Protect our economy. Im a firm believer in economic freedom. But I also agree with Adam Smith that defense is of much more importance than opulence. National security is affected by almost every part of our relationship with China. Beijing knows it and uses American investment and innovation to strengthen its military.

American companies sell billions of dollars worth of goods in the Chinese market, much of it with military application. China also forces technology transfer and steals up to $600 billion of American intellectual property every year. I will push American businesses to leave China as completely as possible.

Advanced technology is especially important. The U.S. Commerce Department keeps a detailed list of the most sensitive technologies that are dangerous to export, but companies can still send them to China. In 2022 the Biden administration approved 70% of licenses for exporting controlled technology to China. I will end these exports.

"" Transform the U.S. military. Its the best way to keep the peace. China is investing more than ever in hypersonic missiles, nuclear weapons, space and cyber warfare, and a cutting-edge navy. The U.S. is at risk of falling behind in each area. The Pentagon must cut through the bureaucracy and field new weapons faster than ever. We cant wait 50 years, or even five years. China isnt.

The U.S. should simultaneously deepen military ties with Japan, South Korea and Australia, and forge stronger bonds with India and the Philippines. We must push Europeans to recognize that China threatens them as much as us. And we should give Taiwan everything it needs to defend itself and ward off a Chinese invasion. If China attacks, it will trigger the war that none of us want.

We must also help Ukraine quickly and decisively defeat the Russians. China is closely watching American resolve in Ukraine. China threatens Taiwan every day. Failure in Europe will encourage war in Asia.

Mr. Biden isnt up to the task of protecting America from communist China. He can do much damage in his remaining 18 months in office. But the damage must end when Mr. Bidens term ends.

China has spent decades preparing to fight. America is now in a dangerous situation against a powerful enemy. The hour is late, but it isnt too late to wake up and take charge of our future. If we rally now, the Chinese Communist Party will end up on the ash-heap of history, like the Soviet Communist Party before it.","1_1"
