Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis wasn't seeking political retaliation when he removed a prosecutor over abortion and transgender views, but simply wanted to ensure state law would be enforced, the governor's attorney told a federal judge Thursday.

Lawyers for Andrew Warren, a Democrat suspended from his twice-elected post as state attorney in Hillsborough County, disagreed, saying it's clear

Just look at how viciously his base threw out any Republican that dared take a stand against his antics.

In today's GOP, loyalty to Trump is seen as the defining attribute the base looks for to consider yourself a true conservative.

However, Trump wasn't always there, and there existed a conservative movement independent of him for several decades. Yes, it's true that the base violently turning on Liz Cheney and her losing her primary by a landslide doesn't look good for Republicans who dissent from Trump, however, other factors were probably at play there, such as how she very much associated herself with Democrats during the January 6th hearings.

Here are some lines I think Ron DeSantis could use against Trump that could work with the base:

* *'Donald hasn't told us why he didn't fire Fauci.'*
* *'What did Trump do in his 4 years in office to fight transgender ideology in our schools?'*
* *'Of course the 2020 election was unfair, but Donald had the power in office to implement proper voter integrity measures, and he did not. He let himself be beaten. He is a LOSER.'*
* *Whether the election was fair or not is irrelevant, the point is that Joe Biden got into the White House and Donald Trump did not. Biden was able to appoint a liberal activist judge to the court, was able to extend Covid restrictions, was able to destroy the economy, and able to impose his woke agenda on Americans and their children.'*
* *'In both 2020 and 2024, Donald has revealed himself to be a burden on the party and a LOSER. We need to get power if we are to ensure conservative justices on the court, to defend America against woke-ism, and to bring Hunter Biden to justice.'*
* *If we nominate Donald a third time, we will get 4 more years of Sleepy Joe. '*
* *'The Democrats would love nothing more than to face 'whining Donald' a third time.'*
* *'I can ensure you, that the Trump campaign is funded by the Democrats.'*
* *'We need somebody who can convince enough voters so that the dirty cheating of the Democrats fails. Once we win despite their attempts to thwart the popular will, we can ensure that nothing like 2020 ever happens again. '*
* *'We need a party that looks forward, not backwards. You can vote for Donald, who has no vision for this great nation other than whining about the previous election, or you can vote for me, who will ensure that the woke menace is eradicated from our institutions, schools, universities, businesses, media, and culture for good.'*

He could also remind people of Donald Trump:

* Holding an LGBT pride flag.
* Being relatively pro-LGBT.
* Being friends with Hillary and Bill Clinton.
* Being friends with Jeffrey Epstein.
* Disrespecting the military.","DeSantis",10,10,0,0.66,0,0,0,48

Ive also recently updated it on my case for why DeSantis is the best choice to lead us out of the war with Ukraine - this portion of the thread (currently- 22 tweets with 35 cited evidence sources/screenshots) lays out the facts surrounding Ukraine and the USAs involvement in it.

The next major update will be breaking down the Democrats response to the pandemic, the vaccine, etc. - mountains of hypocrisy with receipts and evidence to back it all up. This will be a fun addition, early in on my research and dozens of clips of pure hypocrisy from democrats about the vaccine.

Anyways thought Id share the gist - and would be interested in sharing my official Twitter account and the aforementioned tweet thread here if its allowed. Its a great tool for combatting all anti-desantis arguments being made right now by conservative circles. As I develop it, it will include more and more rebuttals to leftist narratives in the context of #DESANTIS2024.

Right now, it kind of feels like Trump just has the whole party hostage and his ego will not allow him to lose the primary then rally behind DeSantis. If DeSantis can't overcome that, it is a guaranteed Democrat win with a split Republican base.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis on Monday signed a bill that gives him control of Walt Disney World's self-governing district, punishing the company over its opposition to the so-called Don't Say Gay law.

The takeover of the Disney district began last year when the entertainment giant publicly opposed Dont Say Gay, which bars instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity in kindergarten through third grade and lessons deemed not age-appropriate.

""Today the corporate kingdom finally comes to an end,"" he said at a bill signing ceremony in Lake Buena Vista. ""There's a new sheriff in town, and accountability will be the order of the day.""

In February, DeSantis called on lawmakers to again return to deal with Disney and finalize state control over the district in another hastily called special session that signaled the governor's willingness to wield the power of state government to accomplish political goals, a strategy that is expected to continue in the coming months ahead of his potential White House run.

&gt;**For this new indictment, we can all judge by ourselves the seriousness of the case.**  
  
&gt;**The main piece of evidence are two recordings of two phone calls that are available to be listened in their entirety on Internet. There is no ""portraying"" issue here. We can directly judge what he said with his own words.**  
  
&gt;**And the reality is that he shamelessly tried to meddle the elections results in Georgia and we would be outragedand rightly soif a Democrat had attempted anything remotely close like that.**  
  
&gt;[Screenshot of the comment and the conversation](https://i.imgur.com/zufhQjF.png).   
&gt;(NB: the comment was modified well before being banned, not after, and only for spelling reasons)  
  
I tried to appeal my ban but my appeal was instantly denied and no attempt to justify their decision was ever made. Here is the ""discussion"" I've had with the moderation team of r/Conservative:  
  
**Current-Values (me)**:  
  
&gt;WTF??? I am a lifelong conservative, I've never voted for anything else than conservative candidates in my entire life and my comment history on Reddit can fully back the fact that I am a genuine conservative.

&gt;Furthermore, the comment made here is not inflammatory or made in bad faith or whatsoever. For sure, I am not pro-Trump and I do criticize him quite a lot, but this r/Conservative is not supposed to be a pro-Trump only subreddit right?

&gt;Could you please review and cancel this ban?

&gt;Thanks,  
  
**r/Conservative moderation team**:

&gt;i have reviewed.. Appeal Denied  
  
**Current-Values (me)**: 
  
&gt;Ok... So would you care at least to give me a quick explanation on why do you think my ban is justified? What did I do wrong exactly?  
  
**r/Conservative moderation team**:  
  
&gt;Note from the moderators:

&gt;You have been banned for breaking the rules here: r7

&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/15rrkjn/-/jwb4akq/  
  
**Current-Values (me)**: 
  
&gt;I get that, but could you formulate one or two sentences to explain to me why my comment allegedly broke this rule?  
  
&gt;Something like: ""Your comment stated that [X] and we consider that [JUSTIFICATION]""  
  
&gt;If not blindly parroting pro-Trump talking points and narratives is worthy of a ban on r/Conservative, I can respect your position but you should make it clear.  
  
&gt;Banning genuine conservatives on a conservative subreddit for simply not being pro-Trump don't seem very fair and smart.  
  
**r/Conservative moderation team**:  
  
&gt;That's on you. Not up for debate.  
  
**Current-Values (me)**:    
  
&gt;I didn't ask for a ""debate"", merely a quick explanation. Just explain your reasoning, that's all I ask.  
  
&gt;I can see that you aren't willing to backpedal, so just say what you think was wrong with my comment and we are done.
