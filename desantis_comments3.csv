I think the sudden deaths should be looked into and not dismissed. 

You could argue that any bad news would deter people from getting the vaccine and thats not whats best for the greater good. Greater good decision making is a slippery slope. Whos to decide whats an appropriate level of greater good for anything? When you have family and friends dying young 1-2 weeks after the vaccine from sudden cardiac events, its hard to sit back and watch people squawking about the greater good.

At the very least, studies need to be performed with retrospective data. The decision to take the vaccine should be the potential vaccine recipients, not political arm twisting and guilt.","5_1"

One of his daughters is a healthcare provider and felt guilty for pushing him to get the vaccine. 

Yes, the vaccine may not be related, but the problem is that there are zero preliminary reports, considering this personally known event happened during the above reported timeframe. 

How is a provider in an emergency room to discern between a cardiac event related to vaccine vs other cardia events? Does the CDC perform retrospective studies for ALL deaths within X number of days from vaccine, or do they only study reports made through VAERS? You think providers have enough time in the emergency room to report this?","5_1_1_2"

 - allowing almost every foreign citizen who illegally enters the country to stay indefinitely. aliens can ignore every immigration court hearing and disappear into the interior. they won't be deported unless they commit a heinous crime. Progressives in this way have clearly flouted immigration enforcement, with the intention of granting citizenship to tens of millions of illegal aliens and ensuring one-party rule.

 - taking away guns from lawful citizens

 - letting violent criminals free without bail

 - Laws which impose fines for ""misgendering"" trans people. Other hate speech laws.

 - Allowing minors to undergo transgender hormone therapy, permanently altering their bodies. Even worse, top surgery for minors. Worst of all, the making of minor eunuchs through bottom surgery. Truly evil.

 - Abortion at 9 months pregnant, so long as the baby is partially inside the mother (except to prevent death or serious injury to the mother). I'm not sure what the limits should be, but third-trimester abortion is virtually infanticide.

 - Holding people in jail for months who merely entered the capitol on Jan. 6 and did not break anything nor attack anyone. These people had no idea they were committing a crime. They should get community service at worst, and no criminal record. The violent criminals should be prosecuted comensurate to other violent criminals in DC.","3_1_1_1_1_1_1"

I'm a single guy. I'm a busy student. Many in the GOP want to outlaw abortion. Both in some states, and nationally. If I were to get a girl pregnant, and abortion wasn't an option, it would legitimately ruin my life. Same with some of my friends. If they got pregnant, their lives would be over. None of us are in a position to raise a child. We'd have to put our careers on hold. Why would I support that?

Some of my friends are gay. Prominent Republicans like Ted Cruz have come out and said ""The Supreme Court was wrong to legalize gay marriage"". How does the fact that gay people can get married matter to anyone at all besides them? Who is this hurting? The GOP is saying they want to hurt my friends. They want to hurt people I care about. Why would I support that?

What has the GOP been running on this cycle? Nothing good. From where I'm sitting, it seems like their entire platform has been complete bullshit.

&gt;It's totally fine that a mob of Trump supporters tried to overthrow the government. We're going to end the investigation into it.

&gt;2020 was stolen. Yeah we have no evidence but just trust us.

&gt;We need to bend over to Putin and just let him take Ukraine without a fight.

&gt;The Democrats want to cut your son's dick off.

&gt;We literally are going to ban books. 

I'm sorry, but that's just not going to cut it. Young people aren't going to vote for that. From what I can see, most if not all of what the GOP ran on either didn't improve my life at all or actively hurt me and people close to me. They need to either get with the times or get left behind.","5"

But will the Trumpist cult vote for him again? I think many of them are more interested in Trump than in conservative politics, and so they will, because in their eyes he can do no wrong.

Lets be blunt, the reason why DeSantis is called Trump with a brain is because he speaks to more well educated people in his approach and rhetoric. Lots of people went for Trump in 2016 precisely because he was crass, offensive, had memorable one liners. Its why he beat the likes of Ted Cruz, who was actually more conservative.

People also dont tend to like backstabbers, and because its true that DeSantis was made through Trumps endorsement, it will be easy for him to be cast as a snake, or the veiled return of the old GOP guard.

Speaking from experience in regards to Britain, Tory members voted for Liz Truss over Rishi Sunak almost solely because of the perception that Rishi had stabbed Boris in the back.

That being said, if the GOP establishment, the national conservatives, and the religious right unite (which they famously did NOT in 2016, divided between Cruz and Rubio) behind DeSantis, then I think the core Trumpist base might be outnumbered. 

The difficulty then is that I am 99% sure Trump will not concede defeat, say the nomination was rigged, and then run as a third party, being a spoiler and giving Biden a second term or another Democrat in the White House.

THAT might be the thing that finally kills him for good, making him a persona non-grata in the 2028 GOP field.","11_1"

Trump said hed reveal evidence that could overturn the 2020 election. And he didnt. Trump said hed release his tax returns. And he didnt.

I could go on. Donald Trump is an incompetent loser. His presidency was broken promise after broken promise after broken promise. Lie after lie after lie. Half of the people he picked for positions denounced his presidency by the end of it, like Mattis or Barr. So much for I only hire the best people I guess. He couldnt even beat Joe Biden. Why the hell would anybody want this guy back in office? DeSantis is the only option for 2024. Trump's guys are all losing tonight. He actively campaigned against Kemp, and Kemp won in a landslide. Walker was his guy and he's up by less than 1 point and he's probably going to lose. A moron could understand that Trump is damaged goods.

I dont understand how this is even a discussion. You dont nominate losers. Not in this day and age. Trump *lost to Joe Biden*, one of the worst candidates in modern political history. Even Hillary and Gore understood that they shouldnt run again, and they at least won the popular vote. Trump cannot win in 2024. A child could understand this. Outside of some weird Revenge on the libs fantasies there is absolutely no reason anybody should want him to run again. Wanting Trump to run in 2024 is just asking for four more years of Democrat control. Anyone who still supports Trump at this point is a fucking moron.","5"

If DeSantis wants to be President, his time is 2024. You don't ""wait your turn"" in politics. Ask Chris Christie about that. In 2012 people called him a shoe-in for the nomination in 2016, but by the time the first primaries came around he was barely an afterthought. 

If DeSantis sat out in 2024 he'd need to wait until 2028. That's an eternity in politics. Six years form now there'd be some new up and coming Republican to steal the spotlight. Tonight's results have shown that Trump is weak and the party is starting to move on from his bullshit. Trump is vulnerable. DeSantis can either run now, and have a *chance* of winning the nomination and then be guaranteed a win in the general, or wait six more years, and have no chance of winning the nomination. It's a simple choice.

Trump is a loser. He lost. And you'd need to be an idiot to vote for a loser in the primaries. And the only people still supporting Trump are idiots. Time for the next man up. People need to accept it.","8_1"

He's just a governor, so speaking about it at all is a lose-lose for him that ultimately has no impact on any actual policy anyways. 

DeSantis is so successful lately because he enacts policy, gets the policy win, and forces the left to debate him on his own terms. It's impossible for him to do that with Ukraine. 

As far as Ukraine goes, I'd rather not piss money away on it, but I also don't really care one way or the other. Ultimately, I would trust him to do whatever is appropriate. If ""toeing the line on Ukraine"" would enable him to prioritize a domestic agenda that includes finishing the border wall, declaring the internet a public space for speech purposes, and removing the LGBTQMAP religion from public schools and institutions, then it would be a worthy trade off.","4"

So the fact that Trump is trying to call those around him disloyal for considering their own campaigns in what is by all accounts an open primary, it is a sign of Trump's real character. He's a self-centered bully who doesn't look for loyalty, he only wants obedience and control of a party he knows he's royally pissed off. I voted for Trump in 2020 knowing he was the best choice; however, it is evident that right now, he is one of the absolute worst people to ever be considered a presidential candidate. 

His policies are fine, and there are times where is loudmouth is actually onto something, but everything else is just about him is utterly unstatesmanlike. He's egotistical, selfish, impulsive, confrontational, boarish, and completely focused on his own agenda and political legacy. Not to mention his recent decisions and statements have been far too concerning. Dining with Kanye West, calling for the arrests of journalists who reported on the Supreme Court leak, cozying up with morons like MTG, and enabling a bunch of deranged performance populists like Biggs and Gaetz to take the reins of the GOP to a point where he can't even keep them under control.

I seriously hope he gets nowhere near the presidential nomination in 2024, but I will most likely vote for him in the general election just so that Biden is out of office. However, if he picks a complete joke like MTG or Kari Lake for VP, then I'm going to the independents or Libertarians solely to ensure that my vote isn't tied to such a disappointment.","2_1"

But it certainly bears the appearance of rational argument.

First off, tell me in what fashion I've ""Moved the goalposts.""

You then say:

\&gt; You also essentially just said that it doesn't matter to you if the facts of this complaint are actually true, because *you've seen videos on Youtube*. 

I actually (and maybe naively) said that you should use this resource for yourself and then answer me if there's nothing intrinsically sexual about drag shows. You've insisted that I demonstrate from the provided examples in the legal complaint that ""children are being groomed."" But if, as I claim, drag shows are inherently sexual, than any example of said show would demonstrate something inappropriate for children. The photos show that much. Though of course the bulk of this complaint regards the specific content of this show, which is indeed vile.

Whether or not I've been to a drag show has nothing to do with my ability to appraise their (obviously) pornographic nature, for reasons I've already listed, and will list again below. Once again, the internet's a swell tool for doing things like making up your mind on adult men gyrating in front of children.

As for the No True Scotsman accusation. I claimed that the performances listed in this document are repulsive to all sane people. You took issue, I can see, with my qualifier ""all sane people."" Now, I wonder if you challenge the generalization that sane, rational people wouldn't want their children to be exposed to pornography. Probably we'd agree there.

My claim (once again) is that drag shows are \*inherently\* pornographic. The photos you have such an issue with show these performers dressed in revealing, provocative drag -- something commonly and obviously associated with pornography.

Now, for the summary. We can probably agree that showing kids pornography is bad. We may also be able to agree that men dressing as women in revealing outfits is pornographic -- it functionally serves the purpose of titillation.

It's not the petty border squabble in some remote country. It's a new cold war started by Russia. And the goal is not Ukraine and not even Europe. If Russia gets the win here, they won't stop until everyone is in a worse state than they are. 

We are lucky, Ukrainians are tough enough to resist, and this war doesn't require NATO boots on the ground. I don't know how it will end, but the US has the best opportunity to delay the USSR 2.0 by years, if not decades. If the price is weapons, we are getting it cheap.

Where there is a chance to attack without full-scale retaliation, they will take it.

One of the books banned was called two mommies and two daddies (might be slightly wrong on the title) and all it talked about was a kid with two moms and another kid with two dads. All the book did was normalize something thats normal to adults, but for kids, and help kids who have same sex parents who might be alone feel like theyre not outcasts just due to who their parents were. Its books like these that are an issue.

Also, speaking of giving and inch and taking a mile, thats exactly what desantis is doing. He passed the dont say gay bill for k-3, which is a pointless bill because everyone agreed that stuff shouldnt be in the hands of kids that young with very very few exceptions. However, plenty of us knew all he wanted to do with that was get a foothold to push it further, which is exactly what he is doing now, just using the success of that to show hes right, and call people who opposed it pedos.


Theres my example. Im not sure if you didnt know about that or are willfully ignorant of it but I hope it helps you realize, this isnt about kids, its about him systematically getting small victories and alienating small groups so he can keep a larger majority","5_1_2_1_1_2"

Why is it okay for desantis to restrict rights to protect children but not okay for democrats?

Also, Im sure you see the same number of same sex and opposite sex couples fawning over one another if you look at it by age group. Theres just a lot more young openly gay people now because they dont have to hide it as much as they did even 10 years ago. Theres no over compensating, youre just more aware of same sex couples since its unusual for you, thats not an issue if you realize it.

It is natural, because its not a conscious choice. Same sex relationships have also been observed in animals without higher brain functions like us. Also, if were just going by nature (seemingly meaning reproductive effectiveness by how you speak) then marriage is inherently unnatural, its much better for a species to just have sex with as many partners as possible, so is that what you support? If not then your argument has a massive flaw, if so then fair enough.

I wouldnt let anyone in the same stall as my 11 year old daughter, but its not my business who is in what public space, so no I wouldnt care if a trans woman (I assume thats what you meant) or a cross dresser (like you said but this is seldom the case) is in the same bathroom as her. Theres no higher chance of them trying to force themselves on my daughter than outside of the bathroom, bad people arent suddenly worse because theyre in a bathroom.

President has very little control on the economy. Our economy is like this for two major reasons, a massive global conflict and a pandemic, as well as many more minor ones, such as chickens dying en mass, the rail accident in east Palestine, etc. as well as obviously companies trying to abuse the system, as they always have.

You should vote by the person, if that person is a puppet dont vote for them. Voting along party lines is exactly what fascists want because it makes an easier us vs them mentality. I say this talking about the fascists on both sides of the party lines, and in the middle.


And finally, if you dont keep up with everything Ron desantis is doing, dont vote for him. If youre not looking at everything he does you will only see his best things because thats what he will pay to be shown, and then when he is in power he will do the bad things just as much as he is already here.","5_1_2_1_1_2_2_1"

I could go on about how DeSantis has actually signed bills to ensure that those types of tragedies don't happen again, but that would never be enough for you.

Good luck on finding a publisher! This is going to sound like a crack, but I mean this genuinely:

Take the amount of time that you spent writing, triple it, and spend that time doing revisions. There are *few* authors that put out quality work in such a short window, and most of them have been dead for a long time.

I mean, I won't know the quality of your's until it gets published, and I don't mean to come off like I'm putting you down, but ""one to two months at a pace of a few pages a night is a normal time frame for completing a book"" is... difficult advice","6_2_1_1_1_1_1"

Sometimes I was accused to be ""woke"" because is said what where was nothing wrong if in a animation is present LGBT charaters or kids with same-sex parents  (no sexual things involved). But other waid that they are opposed to put characters or change races in movies (that I can agree in some degree, but in some cases I see some polemics non-sense like in the Lightyear movie where one of character is lesbian and with her wife had a daughter, why there is a huge problem about that? WHy is treated so differently than a ""traditional"" couple who have kid in cartoon?).","7"

Media has become increasingly woke as they continue to take these things and shove it down the throat of people who dont care. 

My brother-in-laws (8 and 10) watch a show called the loud house. On it theres a character who has two dads, but as far as Im aware its never directly referenced or discussed, its just kinda how it is. Frankly, thats how it should be. The issue arises when you begin to discuss the ideas of romance and the implications of such a relationship in media. When you do it can confuse or impact a childs development and change what they may actually think or feel as they feel socially pressured to do something or may not fully understand what it is that theyre doing.

Are there bigots who are just solely against gay people as a whole? Of course. But, for the most park, wokeness is just a term to describe schools and media pushing topics of sexuality and gender identity onto children who quite frankly are too young to have a discussion like that with. 

Im only covering the sexual portion of this topic, race is a critical one too, but thats also a uniquely American issue as opposed to a European one due to huge demographic, cultural, and historical differences between the two.

If you have any further questions or would like to further discuss the topic Id be more than happy to. Im a native born Floridian and someone whos voted for DeSantis twice, and is overall a supporter of his work as Governor (for the most part).","7_1"

**Racial Pandering / Race Swapping**

Nobody is opposed to racially diverse casting. A racially diverse cast set in modern-day NYC, or some futuristic spacefaring society makes sense and *adds* to the setting. A racially diverse cast set in medieval Scandinavia (Frozen II) does not make sense, and actively undermines the setting of the film.

Race swapping white characters to make your cast more diverse is empty, soulless pandering. It just shows that the creators are completely out of original ideas, and it is ultimately an empty gesture. The Little Mermaid is still a ""white"" story based in European literary tradition. If anything, it's insulting because it implies that there are no non-white stories worth telling. True representation would be to adapt stories from other cultures: there are hundreds of African, Middle Eastern, Asian, Aboriginal, South American, etc. fairy tales that have never had a movie adaptation.  Rather than [race swapping the Queen of England](https://boundingintocomics.com/2020/12/28/netflix-period-drama-bridgerton-features-race-swapped-version-of-historical-figure-queen-charlotte/), make a film about [Joseph Rainey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Rainey), the first black American Congressman.

**Gay Characters in Children's Media**

I'm not going to get into the fact that children of LGBT parents are far more likely to end up LGBT themselves, although it is worth noting, because it raises the possibility that introducing kids to these concepts at an earlier age may impact their future sexuality. ""Traditional"" families are the default and should be treated as such.

Generally speaking, kids' media is designed to show an ideal that we want our children to emulate. Being brave and caring is a trait we want our kids to emulate, so kids' media has a lot of protagonists who are brave and caring. You don't see many ""anti-heroes"" in most children's media for this reason. When characters in children's shows do not live up to those ideals, it is always done in service of a larger lesson (character draws on walls to show why drawing on walls is bad).

When we are talking about the ideal family, every child deserves to have both a mom and a dad who are loving, stay together, and actively involved in their lives. In reality, not every child gets to have that. Some parents get divorced, others die, and others are abusive. Obviously, being adopted by two moms or two dads is better than being tossed around by the foster care system, but that doesn't mean it is *equally* good for children to be raised by same-sex couples. But that doesn't change the fact that it's better for kids to be raised by parents of the opposite sex than it is to be raised by parents of the same sex.

Children's shows often depict kids with only one parent, but the story typically with feature a lesson about overcoming the additional challenges that both the parents and the child face because of it. Every single depiction of gay parents depicts their family as equal to ""traditional"" families in every way, and that is simply untrue.

I would not be opposed to a depiction of two gay (male) parents who go out of way to make sure their child has a female role model in their life, since they are unable to fulfill that role themselves. As long as they realistically depict the fact that it is not the *ideal,* and address the fact that there are additional challenges that come it, I'm okay with it, but to date I've never seen a depiction of gay parents in children's media that is willing to do that.

**Trans Characters in Children's Media**

I am generally opposed to media that lies to children about fundamental basic truths. It is not possible to be anything other than your biological sex, and therefore it is immoral to produce media that lies to children and says that this is possible.","7_2"

I have an idea that all kid deserve to have person who cares of him/her better if the parents was two independenlty is they was same sex or opposite sex. The kids raised by two dads and mums can be raised in good way or bad way like the kid raised in ""traditional"" family, no difference.
I thinks that also the kids must not pitted in a bubble, the kid must know the world around them also about things that parents doesn't like, obviously taking care of age of the kid. An this point I want talk about the ""don't say gay"" bill, 
I'm pro about a law that protect the children in some harmful media, but in that law where was not written that is considered inappropriate, when will become appropriate and who decide that thing become appropriate or not, causing a huge discretion by who decide, and the school begin to censor innocent things by the fear to break this law, and give the impression that to be gay is a wrong thing (you will not censor a thing if you not consider that thing bad). The law can be involved also  the high schools, limiting the facto the freedom of expression of the students granted by the US Constitution. 
I have a fear that with the excuse of ""protecting the children by groomers"" it will begin that the government will begin to censor all things that the government doesn't like  making the association, gay things (like stories with LGBT characters) = explicit sex = pedos.

About ""race swapping"" in show personally I tend to be critical in some cases, but in other cases I think that the situation is over-exagerated for political gain (this from both sides) . About Disney i criticize more criticize more that they do live-action remakes (Disney stop doing live action remakes, make new things) the actor races is a minor things about that movies.","7_2_2"

I run my business. My business runs itself. I dont need the weaponized states jack boot on my throat and more than I need handouts. 

Ive never uncritically followed anything blindly in my life, thats how I got to where I am, and the DeSantis I supported was pro-business. 

If you think the business community doesnt see this as a HUGE question mark, simply put, youre wrong.","5_1"

Disney heavily lobbied for this, and at the time might have been the only practical way for all the infrastructure to be built.

No other theme park in Florida, indeed any other business in Florida got such privileges, and so I can see a strong argument for its elimination in terms of treating all businesses the same.

I dont think it was an expropriation in sense, but by all means provide evidence of this if it is so.

I am very much against government handing out favors to specific businesses&tax breaks for relocation, govt spending on stadiums for teams, etc etc, so this change makes sense to me broadly speaking. Id love to see subsidies for sugar farming ended also, as those had contributed to significant environmental issues in our state.

It is unfortunately true though that Desantis did this out of political revenge.","6"

Disney did this to a degree then unheard of and since unmatched.

Honestly, if DeSantis had done this to correct was was a bad deal for Orlando and Florida (which it was) in a way that preserved the good faith of the state in negotiations with businesses, then Id be all for it. Im all for a level playing field. 

I agree with your bottom line though, sadly this was all just political vengeance targeting a specific company, and thats what I cant get past. 

(I meant expropriation in the sense that the benefits of the unique entity have in a sense been expropriated by the state- the part that looks like expropriation to me is the constitution of the new board- just a bunch of big DeSantis donors- its just bad optics, very banana republic)","6_1"

The most I can fault Desantis for here is doing the right thing for the wrong reasons. I could even argue he did the right thing, for the right reasons, just with wrong timing. But it seems like the right thing.

Then I cast my eyes to the other end of the political spectrum. What I see is blatant and constant abuse of political power to go after enemies and protect their own. From some states suing oil companies for global warming (WTF ?) to some going after gun owners, stores, etc. via pressure of credit card companies, to our highly politicized DOJ, and on and on. Its beyond the pale. Its also different than this action in that they are doing WRONG things, for WRONG reasons.

So, I can def get past it. Indeed, in comparison, Desantis is a bit of a Boy Scout.","6_1_1"

Reedy Creek was not like that, it was a small government, and you had to have a personal stake in the area to participate in this little government. Its not just Disney, it was anyone who lived in Reedy Creek. You paid property taxes, had a business, or a proper residency you had a say period.

 * *Payed out* when letting strings, cables or ropes out, by slacking them. *The rope is payed out! You can pull now.*

If he got a running mate or support from notable Trumpist Republicans, it could help to ease the tension. Besides that, DeSantis would also be more likely to drum up support from moderates and independents, leaving out any real concern to get support from the more.... zealous Trump loyalists. I do believe a good portion of them would still vote for DeSantis to at least get a semblance of the Trump administration back, but more begrudgingly with a sense of reality that they know that this is just what has to happen at that point.","2"

Ive been reading DeSantiss book today and just have to say that its *really* well written and he may bring over more moderates than you realize to make up for not being Trump. 

He seems to have taken the strongest parts of 
Trumpism that overlapped with the (non-woke) left (we shouldnt nationbuild, its a shame what happened to manufacturing, theres a political elite among big business and bureaucracy that does not care about America), and so far has managed to avoid sounding like John Well commit to Iraq for 100 years McCain or Mitt Most Americans are getting a free ride Romney.

If he can just not completely villify Social Security and Medicare in the general, or become gleefully cruel in race-baiting ways, he may have a real shot. Theres something very refreshing about his not being 80, so take heart in that. He *sounds* like someone youd know.","2_1"

While I absolutely agree on the matter of DeSantis having more of a pull towards moderates, I do think you have some good points on concerns like race and federal program-related scares. So these things are vital to understand, especially from the lens of a Democratic, in order to better understand how we can unify on these issues in an appropriate way that ensures everyone gets a fair deal.","2_1_1"
"1252","https://www.reddit.com/r/DeSantis/comments/11e8oiy/if_desantis_does_take_the_primary_and_become_the/","jericho74","2023-03-01",1677685278,3,3,0,0,"Ok! I just finished his book The Courage To Lead, if anyone is interested in my Democrat-but potential-swing thoughts.

Topline: Its great, but IMO he should be a bit more circumspect about ESG and try to learn to see the political wisdom of Joe Manchin on energy policy.

I agree with DeSantis on about 80% of what he says, to the point Im pretty certain I will cast my vote for him in the primary as an acceptable alternative to Biden. Where I disagree (mostly stylistic on debatable social issues) most of it I can overlook.

But where he is going to run into trouble with moderates like me will be around the two major issues he either brushes over or avoids entirely (probably for good reason at this point): Ukraine and climate/energy policy.

I can get behind his issues with Woke Capitalism. If he wants to take on DEI, have at it. Again, Im old enough to remember when conservatives loved corporate power when they overturned Citizens United assuming corporations favored their social politics- so Im a bit jaded, but fine, I can overlook that as I agree DEI is annoying, undemocratic, and ultimately counterproductive on social issues anyway.

My bigger issue is when he goes into ESG, which to someone who does not necessarily believe climate change to be a complete hoax, sounds very dismissive without actually acknowledging the underlying question. 

Im no fan of Greta Thunberg, and definitely see the problem with climate radicalism that devolves into childishness, doomerism and incoherence, but I *do not mind* Joe Manchin on the issue, as will Biden and many moderates.

IMO, the reason BBB passed at the last minute is because Manchin saw an opportunity for American gas and coal companies when Russia invaded Ukraine and screwed Europe. It was then possible for Manchin to contemplate incentives for existing capital that did harmed neither businesses nor Americans, and is ultimately strategically good for the US.

But DeSantis, around pp 240 or so, seems to just leave it at ESG shareholder activism shouldnt be a substitute for changing Americas energy posture. Well, ok, maybe. But who are you attracting with that? Not me and not the gas and coal industry at this point in time.

Changing US energy policy (which is what BBB was) was always a tall order, and it needed to happen already. It hasnt, because of The Swamp and our institutional dysfunction, so there is nothing correct or appealing to me about continued US commitment to Saudi Arabian oil or whatever.

Maybe thats not what he *means*, but surely he wishes to avoid seeming like Mitch McConnell begging Americas petroleum industry (the very interests GOP purportedly represents) to not divest from middle east oil and enable green policies. 

Focus on attacking the self-defeating ridiculous climate radicals, sure, and *coopt* from the radical left. But if not even Exxon is on board with this argument, you can forget moderates.

Maybe Im reading in too much and DeSantis is still drafting his take on climate issues and energy, but Im just pointing out thats the area that is likeliest to prevent me from saying yea, Bidens too old and the far left is out of hand, so I intend to vote for DeSantis. Because *overall* I mostly like him better than any other Republican since Bob Dole.","2_1_1_1"

If DeSantis got the nod for Republican nominee in 2024, who would you want to see as a VP in order to help him better appeal to moderates and independents? I personally want to say Sununu or Capito Moore, although I would love to hear your take.","2_1_1_1_1_1_1"

In even entertaining the notion of voting for Desantis, what Im saying is that my higher priority is an economic shift away from extreme market fundamentalism I associate with Bush/Romney/Cantor/Ryan, and Im willing to bargain on social liberalism short of the outright cruelty Trump trafficked in. This is what initially drew many union households to Trump, and Im willing to reward GOP moderates for voting for BIF and turning their attention to this countrys infrastructure.

I am relatively *indifferent* to wokeism one way or the other. It doesnt personally bother me too
much in that Im not that culturally conservative, but its not my *top* priority, and I can see where excesses from college educated activists present certain obstacles to what is my top priority.

To the extent that I might like, say, Sanders or Elizabeth Warren, I am frustrated that my fellow pro-wage anti-monopolists on the left are often undermined by market-worshipping neoliberals, but also the inconvenience of social justice activists that muddy the waters and turn the public against us.

But the kind of moderate among Democrats I most dislike is someone like Kyrsten Sinema, who says no on higher wages (economic right) and expects a parade for running left on immigration (social left). 

Im not especially anti-immigration, I am just willing to go somewhat right on that issue in order to illustrate to neoliberals that I do not appreciate being sold out on wages. What l am seeking is a different kind of compromise than what, say, a libertarian (who wont like DeSantis for taking a heavy hand with Disney) and a neoliberal would come up with.

Ideally a VP selection would reassure me I am not enabling the worst excesses of social conservatism. So, for example- even though I am likely economically to the left of Nikki Haley, were she the running mate, and with DeSantis presumably focused on my actual priorities, I would be more comfortable that I do not seem to be throwing vulnerable outgroups under the wheel to do so.

I would like both parties to triangulate toward areas of agreement like economic mercantilism, energy, and a serious pivot towards confronting China militarily. I also can find common ground with libertarians on certain green issues, such as the notion that one should be able to produce ones own energy and sell it back to the grid despite what a utility company may say about it.

Id rather *not* see DeSantis try to bring skeptical
Trump supporters aboard by pandering toward racism in a VP pick. That could become a problem. I *am* willing to entertain the idea of a VP pick that solidifies DeSantis support with non-racist Republicans, even ones somewhat to the economic right of myself.","2_1_1_1_1_1_1_1"

Trumps brand has been damaged among republicans pretty heavily though.  I think he could win the nomination still, but he doesnt have the hold on the party he did in 2020.  

Im more concerned about what trump would pull if he loses the nomination.  I dont see him endorsing anyone else, or telling people to get out and vote.  Id expect him to keep attacking nominee.  Maybe even run third party, which is probably worst case scenario.","2_2"

This is my take. I think DeSantis MIGHT be able to overcome the Trump fans that will just refuse to show up to vote for him (I don't think any would vote for a Democrat). However, if Trump runs third or independent, it is easily in the bag for Democrats. They could run the corpse of Jimmy Carter and win. Simply because the Republican base would be so split.","2_2_1"

I generally agree, but with a caveat: If he loses the nomination and a *single one of his indictments* (regardless of what one makes of them) - starts to look like there is a strong possibility of a conviction, he will play ball fast and throw his weight behind the nominated candidate in hopes of securing a pardon.

Grover Cleveland is the only President to have ever been elected to non-consecutive terms:

- 2020: LOST the Popular vote
- 2024: 3rd time's a charm??? Trump convinces an ever-shrinking number of independents to change their view of him? Suuuuuurrre ...

There is *no remaining independent/undecided voter* left for Trump. All minds are made up on that guy. Trump cannot win without their vote.

As boring as the reality may be to Red Hat fanboys, his primary enthusiasm will not translate *at all* into support from independents in the general election.

Not ""pushing"" if there's information. If you're referring to 'reparations' as ""race-based"", I think that's a biased reference. If I understand the concept of reparations it's ""slavery-based.""","1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1"

How is he taking it? Like a little bitch, sore loser. He just whines about his loss. He has no actual strategy as to how he's going to do anything, he just bitches and complains about how he's not in the White House.

For me, personally, the moment I turned away from him for good was when he openly advocated for cancelling entire sections of the US Constitution to allow his loser bitch ass to parachute back into the White House, based upon false pretenses.

So why are you defending Trump if he's lying? 

Shouldn't you be frustrated that Trump is supposedly sitting on a goldmine of evidence and not using it as a defense? 

The defense should be a walk in the park if he actually has evidence. But he doesn't have it. He's lying. His defense says he's lying. He's not calling his defense liars, so he thinks they're telling the truth.

All I said was the Time magazines in Trumps establishments were fakes. This was after someone had made a comment talking about all of Trumps accomplishments as a person, and being a real man everyone else should strive to be. 

Personally Ive never liked Trump this was way before he was president has nothing to do with politics, he was just cruel cheap and vindictive towards people he considered his lessers(which is anyone who is not mega wealthy, or have power above a regular citizen). Ive worked with all kinds of wealthy folks, Trump is just unlikeable once you get to know him. The amount of people we had to forcibly remove when Trump cheated them out of paying what he said he would was annoying, why my company got paid upfront in full. Always felt a little bad for contractors that did a good job like fixing the plumbing, Trump would always cheap out say he wont pay take him to court lol(Dick move that sleazy rich people pull). 

The only reason Im aware of the Time magazines besides being able to Google they were fakes, was because I was part of a large security detail that would remove employees who got caught talking about them being fakes. Even with implied immunity(means I cant be successfully sued for violating your rights, during my work) I just felt bad going at people who had done nothing really wrong, then hearing about Trump screwing them more also had me feeling negative.","1_2_1"

First of all, I hate any polarization, but especially *within the Republican Party,*  and especially among conservatives. 

I don't see black and white; Trump has his faults. Many of them. But someone who's right, say 50% of the time is better than someone (like Biden) who might be right about 5% of the time. 

You've mentioned some of Trump's failures; no argument there. Now let's look at his pluses:

\- 3 GREAT Supreme Court judges

\- Good tax reforms, like doubling the standard deduction. 

\- Amazing job creation (prior to the Covid hysteria, and yes, he's culpable for a good part of that)

\- Cutting red tape

\- Taking on the media

\- Putting good people in cabinet positions, namely Patel, his press secretaries and his ambassador to Germany

\- Four, count them, four Middle East peace deals, including moving the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem

\- Getting North Korea to stop launching missiles over Japan, and got them to the negotiating table. Many Japanese abductees were able to visit their families in Japan when this happened - it's nothing short of a miracle if you follow Japanese news. 

\- Better trade deals with China (his tariff threats largely worked)

\- And an overall attitude of America first

He has his shortcomings, no doubt, but if it comes down to Trump vs Biden are you saying you'd rather sit it out? I personally think DeSantis is the better candidate but if he loses in the primary is it better to just give the keys to the Democrats again? 

DeSantis will definitely come back in 2028 if he loses the primaries in 2024.","3_1_1"
"2074","https://www.reddit.com/r/DeSantis/comments/15gvf6k/if_you_are_a_desantis_supporter_you_would_be_best/","PhilTheThrill1808","2023-08-03",1691084033,1,1,0,0,"This is the most rational pro Trump argument I've seen, genuinely. He certainly does have his plus points. The economy was great, as you said, and the peace deals were fantastic. The only thing I have an issue with is that most, though not all, of the positives were done via executive order. Hence why they mostly got wiped out by Biden so quickly. 

As to a future vote for Trump if he wins the primary- I'm probably out for good. I would most likely vote for whoever the Libertarians put up before I pulled the lever for Trump again. Keep in mind, I'm in Texas. My vote will make absolutely 0 difference either way, we're going red no matter who the nominee is. The media can hype Texas up as ""turning purple"" all they want- it's not true. For example, see Beto's campaign for governor =.

Would I be happy if Trump won a general over Biden (or any other Dem)? Sure, I guess. I just can't really see him doing so, first of all, and even if he did I doubt a President who would be a lame duck for his entire term would be able to make much of a lasting difference. I also see a scenario where he poisons the well for future Republicans if he gets a second term- as per usual, due to a mix of his own failings and media hackery/bullshit.","3_1_1_1"

&gt;Rep. Ron DeSantis has opened up a 12-point lead in Floridas Republican race for governor, according to a new independent poll that indicates President Donald Trump is the key to his success   
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;DeSantis has built his campaign around the support of Trump, who [endorsed](https://www.politico.com/states/florida/story/2017/12/22/trump-endorses-desantis-for-governor-via-twitter-161236) the congressman in December and then followed up with another [endorsement](https://www.politico.com/states/florida/story/2018/06/22/trailing-in-polls-desantis-scores-trumps-full-endorsement-on-twitter-483475) in June,   
&gt;  
&gt;DeSantis has featured the Trump endorsement in his mail and TV ads, which he began running last month. Now that the ads have sunk in, DeSantis leads Putnam 42 percent to 30 percent  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt; Its clear this is all about Trump and this is bad for Adam Putnam,   said Tony Fabrizio a top Republican pollster

It's mostly Anti-Trumpers who want to lose just as much as Only-Trumpers. 

For the most part, it's people who really don't want to give conservatives a win and would much rather see Tim Scott, Nikki Haley or Chris Christie be the nominee.

Which is probably why Romney recently openly shamed anyone who won't be in second place by next February and refuses to drop out. 

To his credit, he's one of the few that understands the feud between conservatives and moderates are only helping Trump and his band of electoral losers maintain their grip on the party. 

It's like I've said countless times: there are people who have a vested interest in losing and want to see the Republican party burn. Both Only-Trump and Anti-Trump have more to gain by losing 2024 than winning. You can say a lot of things about Romney, but he's made it very clear he hates losing and isn't in either of those camps. 

The other obvious point here is the same as 2022:

Regarding equity, though, some groups need a leg up while everything gets sorted out. After slavery was abolished, former slaves didnt have money, homes, or anything to their name really. So they needed to be given an inequitable amount of support while things sorted out.

Your notion that NewsMax likes DeSantis for the primary or general, is flat out wrong.

Also, Trump won the primary in 2016 by convincing people that he was one of them, an outsider, and not a politician. He berated every other politician for political failures so often that nobody had a chance to mention that he himself had no political experience. His off the cuff dialogue had the mainstream media unknowingly campaigning for him by attempting to punish him for his unprofessional conduct on the debate stage but in reality it was just free coverage and advertisement for him.

It was a brilliant strategy on Trumps part and it worked for him. The very MSM that hated him and wanted him to lose ensured he won the primary. But thats not why he won the general in 2016; he won the general election because he wasnt Hillary Clinton. Full stop. Trump never was the populist super hero that he fancies himself in his red hat eco chamber rallies. People just couldnt stand HRC.

DeSantis wants to return the GOP to the party of family, morals, and principles.

2. Wow, wrong again. DeSantis was a JAG officer, a lawyer by trade; not a doctor. His job was the educate the guards of what was and was not legally allowed behavior by them. But at the end of the day, they were not under his command so if they decided to ignore his legal counsel and go on to violate military statutes (like they did) that is not DeSantis's fault. I will say it again, you are reaching.

One of the major concerns regarding Ron DeSantis is his potential lack of broad appeal despite his successes in Florida, including turning a historically swing state to a reliably Republican one. Nonetheless, the concern arises as to whether he possesses the requisite charm and ideological flexibility to engage those on the extreme left, in a way someone like Chris Christie might be able to.

However, in my opinion, Governor DeSantis does have elements in his record that could appeal to centrists, liberals, and even some on the left. 

Govenor DeSantis had proven his ability to lead effectively during times of crisis, most notably during the COVID-19 pandemic, balancing public health concerns with economic considerations. His management of the pandemic in Florida was focused on maintaining the state's economic stability while also addressing health concerns. 

DeSantis has demonstrated a commitment to education, including pay raises for teachers and support for vocational training programs, which could be of interest to those across the political spectrum. 

Hes been open to working with members of both parties on key environmental issues like water quality and restoration of the Everglades. His commitment to the environment could appeal to those on the left who prioritize climate issues. 

Now his conservative positions may not be to the liking of many on the far left, but his effective leadership and impressive electoral victories in Florida show that he can appeal to a broad range of voters.

His 20-point win in Florida, including his success in Miami-Dade county, which Hillary Clinton won over Trump in 2016, underscores his ability to connect with diverse groups of voters. He has been able to successfully communicate his message and win support beyond just the conservative base.

His approach to governance, marked by a balanced consideration of economic vitality alongside public health during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as his focus on education and environmental issues, demonstrate that he has the potential to attract voters from across the political spectrum.

In essence, while DeSantis is indeed conservative, his track record suggests he can be a unifying figure with a wide appeal. He just needs to get out there more. I am afraid hes not doing enough to gain voters from the left.","3"

* Pay off government debt:  Totally a serious and realistic goal.  Indeed, DeSantis just paid off a significant portion of Florida's debt.  This reduces the amount of taxes spent on interest and permits more funding for other programs.
* Prevent teachers from teaching gender ideology to young children:  children are experiencing 1000% increase in suicidal thoughts.  Many are introduced to gender ideology way too young, against parents wishes, and are suffering as a result.
* School choice:  suppose you were not wealthy and the best place you could afford is located in a school district where the school is terrible and crime ridden.  Would you want to be able to send your kid to a different school?  Right now, you can't.  With school choice, you could.  Arizona and Florida have this.  Colorado has a toned down version of this (where you can choose which public school to send your kid to).  This is clearly a great thing for middle and lower income families.  Also, because there's choice, there will be competition.  This will encourage all schools to improve, which benefits everyone (especially if terrible schools are eliminated).
* Ban on abortions after 6 weeks.  Many states are permitting abortions up until the moment of birth.  Several have made it illegal to provide care to botched abortions.  In Colorado, a doctor is providing abortions for any reason up until the day of birth; the procedure starts by injecting poison directly into the child's heart and waiting until it dies.  Our country has gone nuts.  We cannot continue to permit the murder of innocent children like this.  This is the 'woke' agenda that DeSantis speaks of.
* Men cannot compete...  What you are calling a culture war issue has dramatic implications.  Women and girls are being raped in bathrooms and other women's facilities by men who are now allowed to enter because of their gender identity.  This is unacceptable.
* Support police ...   Fentanyl has ruined our cities, is sending masses through misery, ruining our environment.  Given that the drug abusers are affecting all of us by destroying our cities and areas, it is not acceptable to just continue to permit it to happen.
* Support freedom of speech ...  The ""banning of books"" narrative is so incredibly disingenuous.  He did not ban any books; all books can be purchased in Florida.  He prevented pornographic books from being included in the public curriculum of school.  That's totally reasonable.  In all other circumstances, he supports freedom of speech and even gave a platform to many of the knowledgeable (and, it turns out, correct) people who were censored during Covid, including a Stanford medical doctor.","4_1_1_1_2"

Chemically castrating kids? Teaching sexuality and quite literally encouraging it to children? The toxic mentality of CRT that stands to make POC feel like they stand no chance in this country because no matter what whitey will always have a boot on their neck? Obviously theres still a lot of racism and prejudice in this country, but the answer to that is not to make every whitey out to be an evil person solely for being white, especially white males. They call every single person who doesnt follow their rather strict agenda racist, homophobic, transphobic, bigoted (while literally being bigoted their selves), etc etc. 

Hes saying this stuff for a reason and it is a big part of his campaign to reign in on these things. That doesnt mean BAN TRANS and shit, it just means to come to a *reasonable* compromise. The woke agenda is incredibly toxic way too often and only aims to censor and slander anyone, even on their own damn side (RFK and now even Dr West, which is kinda fucking crazy, to name just a few) who doesnt share *every. single*. value of theirs. You dont have to be a bigoted racist homo/transphobic misogynist right wing lunatic to see that *a lot* of this stuff is going way too far. 

But he does also have a lot of values I think anyone could agree with, if they werent already blinded because they think hes a racist homophobic nazi or whatever combination of combination of pejoratives they can come up with& Id highly recommend checking out the interview he did with Russel Brand. Russel challenges him on his views and perspectives several times and I mean he just had solid and honest responses. 

The interviews are where he really shines I think. Piers Morgan did a good one too.

Absolutely, this is why I can stand by him even though I'm a liberal voter in the Philippines (different values, I know, but still). Trump's performative character for most of his presidency was certainly flawed, but I noticed a change from 2020 onwards. His supporters started to co-op the movement and developed it into something relatable and, dare I say, heroic. This was when Trump was getting silenced. It's 2023, and right-wingers are somehow talking about social issues more than the original social justice warriors.

On my end, Duterte was a menace. His final years were spent on creating special commissions packed by military officials that wrestled control over our institutions. Their goal was to change our laws for China's benefit. Since he despised the Constitution, his followers haplessly repeated whatever Duterte's PR guys was cooking (he was already a vegetable by 2021), while their lives were being torn apart by the lockdowns in real time. He did have a slogan... but instead of keeping it within his group, he made it national, called ""Thank you, Duterte."" Mind you, he used administrative state funds for this goodbye celebration. Shit was broadcasted everywhere, not even a single media figure criticizing it.

To be honest, they did do him dirty in the beginning. That part is true. There is no denying that they had an agenda to impeach him; I mean they literally said ""we're gonna impeach him"" before he was even inaugurated. But that's not to say that he's not done some fucking up.

I believe there were fake accusations about him. However, I think he may have actually done some of what he's been accused of; and I believe that we are in dangerous waters, as a nation, if we allow the precedent to be set that if you get acquitted once you can just say ""they're out to get me, don't listen to a word they say"". I refuse to pledge allegiance to a single man. His fervent hatred for anyone who is ""disloyal"" to him is a very alarming signal of how far our Republic has fallen. His victim complex and ego has inflated to the point that he almost appears to believe that *he is the party*. Like he is the sole voice of conservatism and patriotism...it's like wants to be a GOP Pope or something. It's weird and dangerous and I don't like it.

This classified documents case thing is actually shaping up to be a pretty big deal...and I think they may have finally got him on something legit, this time. The MAGA media, like NewsMax and OAN, wouldn't be caught dead uttering a word that was even halfway insinuating that Trump might have had some wrongdoing...so it's no surprise that most of the diehard loyal viewers don't know that the FBI didn't just wake up one morning and kick the door down in Mara Lago to raid his place and look for the documents. The National Archieves spent over a year, politely asking for him to return the documents and he kept playing hardball. So, eventually they said enough of this, go take them, here's a warrant.

The Stormy Daniels thing...yeah, I think he slept with her and paid (or had someone else pay) her off to not say anything. Donald Trump has good enough lawyers that he doesn't pay for things that he didn't do. Also, to be honest, it's not like he is a bastion of good moral behavior...remember ""grab them by the pussy""? Yeah, I could totally see the Donald stepping out on his wife and paying for a night with a porn star.

I'm not going to rehash every single scandal with him, because I'd be here all night. But in the end, I agree that I'm sick of his whiny cries about 2020 and pretending like his misconduct being investigated is part of a crusade he's suffering through for us. He's not what I would consider a true conservative (he has flip flopped so many times on policy, it's enough to give you whip lash) and he's not the best guy to lead the party or nation. We can do better.","3"

An unyielding cult of personality, with a very underrated foreign policy and COVID mandate. People outside America will look back at him favorably ten years from now - for plenty of different reasons.

I would also give credit to 'MAGA people' for voluntarily following his rallies through thick and thin. If shit goes down, they are accountable for any counterprotest or police charges.

I'm a native of the Philippines and neither Duterte nor Marcos have this organic fanbase. The Diehard Duterte Supporters (a.k.a. the DDS) never really show up in rallies. Their behavior is closer to that of Chinese wumaos and ANTIFA - causing a lot of confusion in the shadows to avoid accountability. They've even gotten away doxxing a senator, who's a former justice dept secretary and a fierce Duterte critic, that led her to imprisonment.

Oh yeah, Duterte and his supporters also loved lockdowns, which they have twisted as some form of ""peace and order"" orgy. It's a different from the ""science-based"" thinking of the Democrats.

So as bad as Trump and the MAGA crowd are, they are fighting for something real, at least. They may even be considered 'liberal' compared to the lawless, corrupt leadership accepted by the poorer parts of the world. It's like the opposite of Democrats being viewed conservative in most of Europe.","16"
