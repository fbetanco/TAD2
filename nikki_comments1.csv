"23","2023-10-02",1696221520,"Anybody Have Any Reassuring Evidence That Nikki Haley Could Win The Nomination?","I would love for both parties to rid themselves of Trump / Biden and each put forward their strongest candidate (for the Republicans I feel that's Nikki Haley), however it seems like there's very little chance of that actually happening due to the commanding hold both of these figures have on their parties.  Is there any convincing data or history that would point to Haley's chances of winning the nomination being better than they seem?  The arguments for and against this that I'm already aware of are...

**Arguments Against Her Chances:**

Trump currently holds 55% of the vote (with 35% of Republicans permanently locked in and 20% leaning towards him but open to change) so not only does she have to climb up to second place and knock out all the other candidates before Super Tuesday, but she also has to consolidate the anti-Trump vote and take some of his voters too.  And if any of the other candidates refuse to drop out, playing spoiler like John Kasich did to Ted Cruz in 2016, she automatically loses.  Ramaswamy is of particular concern since he's already a billionaire and may be running to become Trump's VP, so a cabinet offer would be unlikely to convince him to drop out.  And Ron DeSantis is of particular concern too as he may trail her closely enough that he ends up holding out hope for too long and by the time he drops out it ends up being too late (although I could see a VP offer maybe working on him).

None of Trump's various criminal trials will conclude until after the race is over and they don't even start until the day before Super Tuesday and he could end up unaffected or even strengthened by them.  At the start of the year DeSantis and Trump were in a tight race, however once the indictments started rolling in, more and more Republicans rallied around Trump as their candidate in a compulsive need to defend him.  And overall Trump's lead has been very durable, further demonstrated by the fact that the first debate had zero lasting impact on his polling numbers.

Trump also has a massive number of endorsements.  Going by the 538 methodology he has 365 points compared to the 90 points the rest of the field has combined (nobody wants to get attacked by Trump and his base for endorsing someone other than him).

Republicans have spent the past six years choosing awful MAGA candidates Independents hate instead of prioritizing winning candidates like the Democrats usually do.  This hurts Haley since she's a winning candidate not a MAGA candidate.  You would think the Republicans would learn their lesson after three lost elections in a row, but I have serious doubts.

In regard to Haley versus DeSantis, something that could hurt her is that the polls currently indicate that he is the majority of Republicans' second choice should their preferred candidate drop out.

**Arguments In Favor Of Her Chances:**

If I'm not mistaken, back in 2007, at this point in the race, Clinton held a similarly massive lead over the rest of the field, but she ultimately ended up losing to Obama, which could point to this not necessarily being a done deal yet.  Furthermore, of the four past races with similarly large gaps, the leading candidate lost half of them, (although Trump's situation is completely unprecedented, and I'd be inclined to believe his past incumbency benefits him greatly).

Haley has been spending the most time campaigning on the ground in these early states of any candidate by far and will also likely continue to keep winning these presidential debates.  Because of this, there's a solid chance she continues to rise in the polls and eventually passes DeSantis before the race even begins.  She could also end up being massively helped by the fact that she's clearly the most electable candidate by a large margin (something that has been shown in public polls and leaks from the Democratic party) due to her being a relatively young woman of color with a calm demeanor (return to normalcy candidate), a strong gubernatorial track record, and policy positions that appeal to moderates; electability being the strongest argument against Trump but something the other candidates haven't been able to demonstrate being any better than Trump on.

The polls could be greatly overestimating Trump's support due to the fact we're still very far off from the election and historically people still aren't paying very much attention at this point (which benefits Trump due to him having by far the strongest name recognition of Republican in the country).  As we near election day and people start paying attention, the polls could tighten.  And on the day people step into that voting booth and are forced to contemplate their decision, when push comes to shove they may actually find themselves indeed weighed down by his impending legal troubles, caving in and voting for the candidate they think can best win a general election as opposed to the candidate who would be the most satisfying middle finger to the Democratic party.

Trump's fundraising has been pretty weak and he's spending almost all of it on his legal bills instead of actually using it to try to win over voters.  Furthermore, his fraud trial is already a forgone conclusion due to it taking place in New York, meaning around the time the race begins Trump will lose access to all his New York assets (which is most of his assets) and will be fined a quarter of a billion dollars on top of that, putting him in notable financial trouble for personally funding a campaign.

In regard to Haley versus DeSantis, in contrast to her upward momentum, he has downward momentum.  There's also a bit of a self-fulfilling prophesy going on because by having the entire media constantly talk about how she's on the rise and he's on the fall, it makes voters feel more confident about switching to her and less confident about sticking with him.  He also has significant charisma issues whereas she's easily in the Top 3 in terms of charisma.

&amp;#x200B;

Unfortunately for me though the negatives (particularly that gargantuan polling gap between him and the rest of the field) are significantly outweighing the positives, so if anybody has any convincing evidence for her chances, I'd love to see it, I would like to be able to be more hopeful about her chances rather than feel like both parties are doomed to push the same crappy nominees again.","nikkihaley",8,"https://www.reddit.com/r/nikkihaley/comments/16xna56/anybody_have_any_reassuring_evidence_that_nikki/"

"25","2023-09-29",1695958582,"I think Nikki Haley has a shot at the presidency.","I left the Democratic party to register Republican, but I can associate with the MAGA crowd. I guess I've come full circle, I was a Republican before I was legally allowed to vote, spent my young adult years as a Democrat and now back to a Republican. I realized the Democrats don't have my interests, this isn't the Democrats of 25 years ago that wanted to protect workers and wages. 

I have my issues with Nikki Haley, I just think they're tolerable compared to the alternatives.

1.) A senile Biden in 2024 again?

2.) Kamala in office after Biden dies?

3.) Trump is old news, I think normal people are beginning to realize it's time to move on.

The two debates have sold to me that Nikki Haley is at least a leader. People aren't happy that she's combative, we need someone like that in the White House now. Nikki isn't vain like Trump when she asserts some authority, it's coming from a place of respect for the law. 

I don't support her war politics, but immigration is simple and to the point; deport the ones here illegally and end it there. I'm someone who doesn't give a shit about white America declining, I don't give a shit about Spanish growing alongside English. What I care about is cartel gangs not carving my head up and leaving it outside my driveway. 

I'm not in favor of invading Mexico, but we need to defend our border and show the cartels we mean business. I don't believe foreign gangs deserve justice, if you invade our country, you should be dealt with swiftly. 

So, I see a potential two term president, just unsure what the GOP will do with Trump. Republicans are in a quandary where they don't want him, but they can't alienate their constituency and flat out ignore him.

1. Her position on China is incredibly aggressive. She mentioned completely cutting off trade to China. This is an extreme position in my opinion and is difficult to sell to the American people. 

2. Haley spent too much time being combative on stage. I liked her confidence and ability to think on her feet but would prefer to see that combativeness be focused on Biden.

If you insist that military members and their family relocate to a location where medical treatment to which they have a right is not available and you refuse to cover the cost of travel, then you have two options.

A)  You allow military members to decide where they wish to be stationed.

B) You close all bases in areas that can not/will not provide medical treatment.

Both A and B result in the same thing, MASSIVE base closures across the entire South.  Easily cut the number of military bases in red states in half, if not removing them completely.

OR.... and this is radical, I know...

Let the military handle these issues as the military sees fit because it's not Congress' job to dictate issues regarding individual medical treatment.

Dear Mrs Haley,

*For clarity, I am not a democrat.* *Nor am I a republican. I support the Peoples Party. Red and blue be damned!*

Wednesday night America turned on the television to get an idea of what is ahead of us this next year. Most werent hopeful. But imagine our surprise when a politician stood on stage in front of the whole world and told the truth! Your answers echoed what many Americans have been waiting for. Finally, a politician that is listening to us! A politician that will bridge the divide that is destroying us rather than encouraging it. We heard the passion for honesty, equality, and morality. We watched you refuse to go low and stand on your own merits without attacking any of the other candidates nor the current administration. We saw someone that demonstrated respect for the institution even when you dont agree with them. We heard you in everything you said and everything you didnt say. A glimmer of hope for America!! I was ready to get my t-shirt! 

Nikki Haley #thepeoplesparty 

And then&. In an instant, that glimmer of hope was extinguished. You.. raised.. your.. hand? My jaw hit the floor and I sat stunned. No!! She cant be saying what we heard! When I recovered from my shock, I thought to myself, give her a chance. Maybe it was an impulsive moment, not quite prepared for. You tow the party line& right? Just maybe she will hear us and rethink that single moment that crushed our hope for the future. And we WILL get her into the White House one day! Even if she doesnt win this primary, she will surely bring us back from the brink of implosion in 2028. We can have hope!

And then&. you doubled down. Sigh&. You DID mean to raise your hand. You really WILL support the most morally corrupt and deplorable president of our time. You will stand up and lie to the American people. Because we heard you say, even without the explicit words, you do not believe HE is the best choice to be the role model for our children. What happened to the truth telling? What could Vice President Harris have ever done to make anyone think Ex President Trump would be a better choice to lead us back to humanity? Politics be damned!! Supporting this man and his shenanigans will be telling our children it is absolutely acceptable for a man to sexually harass, man handle, and even abuse a woman. As long as hes not a democrat. How can anyone support the selfishness demonstrated on January 6th? Teaching our children that if we dont get what we want its acceptable to throw a tantrum and step on people until you get your way. The Constitution was trampled on and people were physically hurt! Are you, Nikki Haley, really willing to compromise and disregard the very morals that make you the perfect choice for #thepeoplesparty? To what end? Just to tow the party line? 

Maybe you have sold your soul to the devil. We are left wondering how little it would take to sell out the soul of America.

If you scour social media, you will see the above opinions everywhere. You clearly won that debate! Until you didnt&. The people are ready for a change. We deserve better.

"58","2023-07-30",1690732371,"Haley can Pivot to the middle and win this race","I think that there is a chance (however small) that Nikki Haley can pivot to the middle, gain likability by the vast majority of American voters and win this race. The battle will be an arduous one, however, and the deck is almost fully stacked against her.

There are a few avenues with which she can do it, none of which strident conservative voters (and even more so, Republican voters -tm) will like. However, if a former NY iconoclastic liberal Democrat like Donald Trump could win the Republican nomination by a landslide (and appears to be able to do so again in 2024, if nothing changes), then I truly believe some changes can lead Nikki Haley to the coveted spot.

1. Follow in the steps of Bloomberg as a (mostly) non-partisan pragmatist:  this is something that will have to develop with deft timing so that it doesnt fudge her chances at being the nominee, but whether you like it or not, the role of Evangelical Christian voters getting absolutely everything they want with no compromises is bound to end. With Roe overturned and several other landmark conservative decisions by SCOTUS, any strong motivations to get out the vote on grounds of modifying the courts and its decisions lie squarely in favor of the Democrats. Therefore, to alleviate that, you need to nominate a candidate who will toe a fine line and promise to make judicious nominations to the courts (so as not to add fire to the Democrats driving power in this area, but also not to motivate Republicans to oust her or stay home). Its a political dance that only Nikki could likely pull off. She would have to argue to a populace that seems to have largely abandoned principles and an idea of basic human common sense, in exchange for appeals to emotion, outrage, fear and groupthink (and this goes for the right as much as it does the left).

2. Not only talk the talk but walk the walk of unification: Biden talked a lot about repairing the soul of America in 2020/2021, and of healing divisions between left and right leaning segments of the nation. However, undercurrent tensions have hardly ever been worse, and we now likely have a country where most citizens wear one of two pairs of VR headsets, each showing them a vastly different reality from the other. From movies to music to climate to culture to family, and even principles like the interpretation of our freedoms (whether it be over our bodies or our trades), you have a two concentrated poles of opposing views like never before. Nikki needs to toe a very difficult line of where we can all agree, without meaningless cliches and without over-imposing or chastising/subordinating large swaths of the American public. Its a complicated task, but unlike Biden, she seems to have the intact neurons and glial cells to achieve it.

3. A fundamentally new brand: Trump did this in 2016 by (knowingly or unknowingly) popularizing a break from common economic and political theory around the exponentially greater value of global connectedness (of course there are downsides/risks to over-connectedness in trade, culture and even ideas) in a way that was simple and resonated with so many American voters; Obama did it (arguably, somewhat more easily and expectedly) in 2008 with an idea that hopeful idealism has a place in policy-making, and that centralized decision-making (by a small number of well-informed, qualified scientists &amp; experts) would not only end the calamities of the Great Recession but could progress us to a utopian society where everyone has a shot at at self-actualization (the flip side of his script being that there are a selfish/idealless but powerful few who are actively in the way of this).

Biden truly lacks such a vision or fundamentally new idea (and AFAIK so does Kamala, who will likely be our next POTUS, if Biden wins re-election in 2024, as expected). His message of unity is simply a thinly veneered repudiation of Trumpism and thats why it doesnt really work. If Nikki can provide a new additive and inspiring vision leading to a better tomorrow (and that vision is something we believe we havent really tried before; as were Obamas and Trumps visions), versus just piling onto the culture wars (a la Desantis), she just might become the first female President of the US.","nikkihaley",6,"https://www.reddit.com/r/nikkihaley/comments/15down7/haley_can_pivot_to_the_middle_and_win_this_race/"

CNN anchor and chief Washington correspondent Jake Tapper will moderate the event, which will air at 8 p.m. ET on June 4.

The former South Carolina governor is one of many Republicans in a [growing field of candidates](https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/14/politics/2024-republican-presidential-contenders-list/index.html) who are vying for the partys presidential nomination and who are heavily focused on Iowa  a state early in the primary election calendar that can make or break a campaigns momentum.

Haley, who served almost two years as US ambassador to the United Nations during the Trump administration, has had to navigate running against her former boss and the current GOP front-runner.

The first woman elected as governor of South Carolina, Haley is also running against South Carolina [Sen. Tim Scott](https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/22/politics/tim-scott-2024-presidential-campaign/index.html), who she first appointed to the US Senate in 2012 to fill a vacancy left by Sen.

Former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, tech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy and talk radio host Larry Elder are also running for the GOP nomination, and [Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis](https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/23/politics/ron-desantis-elon-musk-president-announcement/index.html) is expected to announce his candidacy for president Wednesday evening.

The first, moderated by Kaitlan Collins, [featured former President Donald Trump](https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-cnn-town-hall/index.html) in New Hampshire.

Don lemon said on CNN she had no right to criticize Trump's mental capacity because women are out of their prime by the time they're in their 40s.  That has nothing to do with women's minds and everything to do with sex and reproduction, and having kids while in office isn't a thing most presidents have done, but that man didn't see fit to actually think about the thing he googled, he just regurgitated sexist shit to a national audience.   


So if you're a woman supporting Haley, just mentally prepare yourself for the hate that you're going to see come out of the woodwork, sometimes from places you wouldn't expect. and it's exhausting because it'll be everywhere, always. And if you're a man supporting Haley, you'll see it too, so be nice to women, especially fellow Haley supporters, because it's difficult seeing a woman you respect, who is so much more successful and powerful than you, who has achieved more than you can ever hope to achieve, being treated so poorly simply because she was born without dangly bits


Good luck (not with the election, just with dealing with the hate)
