Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis wasn't seeking political retaliation when he removed a prosecutor over abortion and transgender views, but simply wanted to ensure state law would be enforced, the governor's attorney told a federal judge Thursday.

"Rhetoric DeSantis Can Use Against Trump","2022-11-11",1668177149,"Rhetoric DeSantis Can Use Against Trump","Republicans are frightened of Donald Trump, and they have good reason to be. Just look at how viciously his base threw out any Republican that dared take a stand against his antics.

In today's GOP, loyalty to Trump is seen as the defining attribute the base looks for to consider yourself a true conservative.

However, Trump wasn't always there, and there existed a conservative movement independent of him for several decades. Yes, it's true that the base violently turning on Liz Cheney and her losing her primary by a landslide doesn't look good for Republicans who dissent from Trump, however, other factors were probably at play there, such as how she very much associated herself with Democrats during the January 6th hearings.

Here are some lines I think Ron DeSantis could use against Trump that could work with the base:

* *'Donald hasn't told us why he didn't fire Fauci.'*
* *'What did Trump do in his 4 years in office to fight transgender ideology in our schools?'*
* *'Of course the 2020 election was unfair, but Donald had the power in office to implement proper voter integrity measures, and he did not. He let himself be beaten. He is a LOSER.'*
* *Whether the election was fair or not is irrelevant, the point is that Joe Biden got into the White House and Donald Trump did not. Biden was able to appoint a liberal activist judge to the court, was able to extend Covid restrictions, was able to destroy the economy, and able to impose his woke agenda on Americans and their children.'*
* *'In both 2020 and 2024, Donald has revealed himself to be a burden on the party and a LOSER. We need to get power if we are to ensure conservative justices on the court, to defend America against woke-ism, and to bring Hunter Biden to justice.'*
* *If we nominate Donald a third time, we will get 4 more years of Sleepy Joe. '*
* *'The Democrats would love nothing more than to face 'whining Donald' a third time.'*
* *'I can ensure you, that the Trump campaign is funded by the Democrats.'*
* *'We need somebody who can convince enough voters so that the dirty cheating of the Democrats fails. Once we win despite their attempts to thwart the popular will, we can ensure that nothing like 2020 ever happens again. '*
* *'We need a party that looks forward, not backwards. You can vote for Donald, who has no vision for this great nation other than whining about the previous election, or you can vote for me, who will ensure that the woke menace is eradicated from our institutions, schools, universities, businesses, media, and culture for good.'*

He could also remind people of Donald Trump:

* Holding an LGBT pride flag.
* Being relatively pro-LGBT.
* Being friends with Hillary and Bill Clinton.
* Being friends with Jeffrey Epstein.
* Disrespecting the military.","DeSantis",48,"https://www.reddit.com/r/DeSantis/comments/ysc7as/rhetoric_desantis_can_use_against_trump/"

The mod team told me their bot banned me from the sub because I participate in subs that spread misinformation I told them I broke no sub rules and kept myself apolitical in that sub out of respect for others. The mod team told me my ban stands, as Orlando did when I tried to appeal to the mod team there.

But we just saw in the midterms, that because of Trump's presence and those he propped up, he lost what was probably one of the most winnable midterms in modern history... Most people thought the Democrats were going to get wiped out. 

So my question, how is someone like DeSantis and other Republicans going to frame Trump's electability in 2024? Is he going to call him  unelectable? 

Is Trump now as toxic as Hillary Clinton was in 2020, where Progressives said she was **literally** the only person who could have possibly lost to Trump, Donald preceding to lose to someone who clearly has some kind of dementia.

Trump: didn't fire Anthony Fauci, he didn't keep the ban implemented by the Obama administration to keep gain of function illegal, he spent billions of taxpayer money on Warp Speed to get a vaccine out in a timely manner that has largely been seen to be ineffective or even possibly dangerous to our youth, and had publicly stated at rallies that he supports the vaccine and that Democrats shouldn't be allowed to take credit for it.

So not only is he encouraging people that take the vaccine, he also played both sides by saying that his supporters had nothing to worry about. Which is it?? 

Do we need the vaccine because the virus was actually extremely dangerous, and he lied to us because he thought campaigning was more important than protecting his supporters? Hell, by that logic maybe the reason he actually lost, with because he killed so many of his own supporters.

Or was the virus not dangerous, and he sold out to big pharma on a level unseen by any US president in history. Giving billions to complete hacks, that changed the very culture of the world when dealing with flu season. 

Never mind Anthony Fauci, go after the man who could have fired him, and let him resume gain of function research.","DeSantis",9,"https://www.reddit.com/r/DeSantis/comments/zlv9b4/trump_wants_credit_for_the_covid_vaccine_is_this/"

DeSantis is in a tricky position where the further-right would be looking at him as a potential globalist and NeoCon while those who are more moderate/left-leaning could see him as too conservative and Trump-like. So DeSantis would definitely need someone who can counter both claims while serving as a strong choice for a president's second-in-command.

"33","2023-02-10",1676051388,"As much as I love Desantis so far, I have a couple concerns that maybe someone could clarify:","The first, is the alleged claim that when Desantis first arrived in office in 2018-2019, that he was more moderate/centrist in his policies and campaigning, but abruptly shifted right in mid-2020. I only became aware of him in 2021, so I couldnt follow him before then. Can anyone here verify if its true that he did have a sudden ideological shift? And if so, do you find it suspicious? Why would he start out more neutral, then shift right, to rile up a conservative base? Some may argue that, but I feel hes sincere, and hes not just doing these actions to rile up a base just for the sake of it. Is he just catering to whatever party it takes to win, like some liberals say? I hope not.

Second, how do you feel about his alleged interference with small-business? Republicans are known for being the small-government party, and while Desantis seems to respect and be loyal to that idea, how do you feel about banning vaccine passport requirements? Or banning CRT from the classroom (which I support anyway)?

Overall, do you think hes sincere in his ideology, and truly reflects the beliefs of the average modern conservative?","DeSantis",14,"https://www.reddit.com/r/DeSantis/comments/10yy57o/as_much_as_i_love_desantis_so_far_i_have_a_couple/"

Ive also recently updated it on my case for why DeSantis is the best choice to lead us out of the war with Ukraine - this portion of the thread (currently- 22 tweets with 35 cited evidence sources/screenshots) lays out the facts surrounding Ukraine and the USAs involvement in it.

The next major update will be breaking down the Democrats response to the pandemic, the vaccine, etc. - mountains of hypocrisy with receipts and evidence to back it all up. This will be a fun addition, early in on my research and dozens of clips of pure hypocrisy from democrats about the vaccine.

Anyways thought Id share the gist - and would be interested in sharing my official Twitter account and the aforementioned tweet thread here if its allowed. Its a great tool for combatting all anti-desantis arguments being made right now by conservative circles. As I develop it, it will include more and more rebuttals to leftist narratives in the context of #DESANTIS2024.

The question is, can DeSantis capture enough independent voters to overcome the die hard Trump people that would vote for Trump if he ran third/independent or that just wouldn't show up as an offended Trump talks shit on DeSantis leading up to the general?

Right now, it kind of feels like Trump just has the whole party hostage and his ego will not allow him to lose the primary then rally behind DeSantis. If DeSantis can't overcome that, it is a guaranteed Democrat win with a split Republican base.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis on Monday signed a bill that gives him control of WaltÂ DisneyÂ World's self-governing district, punishing the company over its opposition to the so-called Don't Say Gay law.

The takeover of the Disney district began last year when the entertainment giant publicly opposedÂ Dont Say Gay,Â which bars instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity in kindergarten through third grade and lessons deemed not age-appropriate.

""Today the corporate kingdom finally comes to an end,"" he said at a bill signing ceremony in Lake Buena Vista. ""There's a new sheriff in town, and accountability will be the order of the day.""

In February, DeSantis called on lawmakers to again return to deal with Disney and finalize state control over the district in another hastily called special session that signaled the governor's willingness to wield the power of state government to accomplish political goals, a strategy that is expected to continue in the coming months ahead of his potential White House run.

They develop a lot of Strawmen arguments as well.  They purposefully misrepresent DeSantis in a dramatic emotionally charged fashion.

What do you do with this?

In my experience:

**A good offense is the best defense** (stop having to respond by being the person who frames the narrative first).

**Actual facts and details** (when you can find them as most search engines won't even show them).  However, I find it is best not to JADE (justify, argue, defend, or explain).  If your audience is genuine or if you want onlookers to see the truth, then it is worthwhile to focus on details and facts.

**Mocking dismissal** is a good strategy.  You don't want to be seeking approval.

Board members picked by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis to oversee the governance of WaltÂ DisneyÂ World said Wednesday that theirÂ Disney-controlled predecessors pulled a fast one on them by passing restrictive covenants that strip the new board of many of its powers.

The current supervisors of the Central Florida Tourism Oversight District said at a meeting that their predecessors last month signed a development agreement with the company that gaveÂ DisneyÂ maximum developmental power over the theme park resort's 27,000 acres in central Florida.

The five supervisors were appointed by the Republican governor to the board after the Florida Legislature overhauledÂ Disney's government in retaliation for the entertainment giant publicly opposing so-called Dont Say Gay legislation that bars instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity in kindergarten through third grade, as well as lessons deemed not age-appropriate.

Yet this superstar conservative warrior has failed to sign any true abortion restriction into law. The 15-week bill does nothing to prevent the vast majority of abortions. This despite having had big GOP majorities in both chambers of the state legislature, who have proven more than eager to go along with DeSantiss legislative wishes. I hear that he might be close to signing a six-week ban, but that is both too little and too late to be considered a leader of the conservative movement in my opinion. Ive heard plenty of excuses from the legislature being busy to the courts holding it up, but none have been true or holding of water. It seems that a candidate to lead the GOP should at the very least be able to take action on this crucial issue of life and death, no? From an outsiders perspective, it seems that he was too politically cowardly to take steps to end the massacre of innocent babies. He wanted a major re-election victory and saw banning abortion from conception as potentially hampering that goal.

Also, I dont hate Trump. For the most part, I like him because he governed conservatively when he was president. I would definitely vote for him, but I like Desantis more. Plus, I dont think Trump will beat Biden as he is too polarizing. 

I saw someone in this sub mention something that had not occurred to me, and it has me a little concerned. If Desantis wins the nomination over Trump, Trump will just run as a third party candidate. I definitely see this being likely; hed rather drag Desantis down than let him get more popular than himself. That puts us in horrible situation, choosing between a Trump nomination and likely lose to Biden, or a Desantis nomination with a split in the vote and a lose to Biden.

Problem is, even though Ron loves his red meat culture war BS, banning abortions and books and taking away the rights of LGBT people isn't something most Americans support. I'm not even getting into that- I'm just stating a fact. Most people don't like this.

But before he could even make a failed case to America, he has to earn the nomination. Trump's support is so strong that literally no matter what happens, even if Desantis *were* to somehow win the nomination, Trump will claim it was rigged, run as a third party, and spend more time tearing down Desantis than Biden. 


And the funniest part? The right wing mainstream media has created such a cult around Trump, that they'll believe him! Desantis is a groomer? Sure! Desantis rigged the election with the RINO globalists? Yep, checks out. Desantis doesn't have a tenth of Trumps charisma. 

There is quite literally no way for Republicans to win in 2024. Trump wins the nomination? Great- now he loses to Biden. Midterms showed that people are sick of this fascist shit.

Florida Gov.Â Ron DeSantisÂ hoped his first international trade mission would generate lucrative business deals and boost his foreign policy resume ahead of an expected presidential run. Instead,Â he faced questionsÂ about losing ground to former PresidentÂ Donald TrumpÂ and being takenÂ to court by Walt Disney World.

The trip reflected the intensifying pressure confronting DeSantis as some of his allies growÂ increasingly anxiousÂ about his White House prospects. Within a few short years, he rose from relatively a relatively obscure congressman to Trump's leading Republican rival by embracing the former president's cultural grievances without the constant tumult.

Trump CAN'T win with Moderates and Women, He's underwater in ALL the swing states he NEEDS to win He's unpopular with 2/3 of the country and already lost to Biden once , My issue with most Trump supporters is that they are so blinded by his ""Brand and Ego"" they seem to be unable to make calculated decisions or look at things objectively. Some crazies still think the dude is the real President and the military is going to reinstate him lol.  Look at how the media is handling Trump Vs. DeSantis. They have a vested interest in keeping Trump as the front runner, First he's a goldmine for ratings and second they believe he's way more beatable than Ron.  Hell look at Biden's reelection video: Not a single thing on his accomplishments as President it was all Orange man bad and J6 footage. I highly doubt Biden would be running again if Trump wasn't the front runner, He even said as much in an interview. Ron in Florida was the only one who had a Red wave. Every Trump candidate lost in 2020 but 1 while Ron won by 20 points. Ron gave his war chest to other candidates to advance the conservative agenda and get down ballot republicans across the finish line. Trump raised Millions on the ""Stop the steal"" campaign after 2020, Where is that money? did it go to his republican candidates in 2022, Did it go to help J6 Political prisoners?

&amp;#x200B;

The political climate in this country is becoming more and more toxic every cycle IMO it's going to become increasingly hard for candidates to have back to back terms. That being said this country's politics  is like a pendulum and I think it's unreasonable to tell Ron to wait his turn in 2028. That would imply you genuinely believe the USA will have a chance at12 consecutive years of republican leadership. The whole Disloyalty argument is so pompous and elitist, Funny how it's only used against Ron because he's the biggest threat and not the others running.

&amp;#x200B;

Way more Pros for DeSantis than Trump, it's logic and Math.

Able to win moderates Women and some Regan Dems

8 possible years

More possible SCOTUS nominees

Better at fighting culture war

More articulate while giving media and dems big F U

Already going up against the bureaucracy

Young

Better governance

Actually advancing conservatism and the agenda

Ron would win all the states Trump had in 2020 Plus win the swing states

270 is the key and DeSantis knows this.

DeSantis out performance with Moderates + Women

Balanced Florida budget and implemented base 0

Constitution carry (While Trump banned bump stocks)

School of choice + vouchers

Protecting Kids and Sports

&amp;#x200B;

Trumps pros are

No worry on running for reelection

Schedule ""F"" fire everybody (Although I truly believe this schedule ""F"" gimmick will be the 2024 version of 2016 ""Lock her up"" and we see how well that went)

&amp;#x200B;

Honestly ask yourself with all the anti Trump republicans how much time in his 4 years do you think he'll have to get stuff done. After or If all of his people are confirmed how many years do you think we have to work with? Thats not even mentioning guaranteed impeachment attempts further jamming up his ability to implement policy.

Trump is attacking Ron from the LEFT and making Ron look better while most of his attacks come across as childish.

Trump has MANY looming indictments, He wont get a fair shake and WILL get a guilty Verdict. (Possibly keeping him off the ballot in some states) talk about a waste of a vote.

Just please ask yourself is your Trump vote worth a possible XXX more years with Biden and maybe a chance for Kamala (lets be honest Biden isn't making it 5 more years)

&amp;#x200B;

IMO the risk isn't worth the reward. Trump/Biden debates were horrible and made Trump look bad

DeSantis/Biden debate would go horribly  for Biden

&amp;#x200B;

Disclaimer: I'm completely on team DeSantis BUT I will fully support the nominee as if you sit out on principle thats how democrats get elected.

Two years ago, signingÂ a billÂ intended to punish Twitter and other major social media companies,Â Florida Gov. Ron DeSantisÂ blasted the platforms as ""suppressing ideas during the COVID-19 pandemic and silencing conservative voices.

What a turnaround.

The newÂ Elon Musk-owned version of Twitter helped DeSantis launch his bid for theÂ Republican presidential nominationÂ Wednesday. Though it wasÂ marred by technical glitchesÂ andÂ skewered by the candidate's critics, the forum nevertheless underscored Twitter's unmistakable shift to the right under Musk, who bought it for $44 billion and took over in October.

Instead, DeSantis should campaign more directly on local issues caused by national policy, and do so in a more hardcore way. Here are some ideas regarding how to criticize California:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Really go after Gavin Newsom way more than usual. California's current regime should be demonized the same way a good person would demonize Maduro. The Newsom regime incubates vicious attacks on political dissenters, often killing them. Look at how 	Gavin Newsom's supporters murdered Diego Stolz because they didn't 	like how he was studying. Gavin Newsom made sure that the murderers 	of Diego Stolz saw no jail time and continues to call for gun 	control because he wants the vulnerable beaten into comas or to 	death.  
 
2. Properly define wokeness to reflect how the term is used. Wokeness is the support of policies designed to encourage the suffering of the vulnerable but virtuous for the pleasure and 	amusement of depraved elites. Its most common acceptation derives from the practice of oligarchic elites' supporters beating their opponents unconscious. We should all be using the phrase ""murdered in vicious acts of wokeness"" to describe the murders of people like Christopher Michael Wright.  
 
3. Try to convince a guy like Elon Musk to buy a dictionary company and properly define the words to reflect how they're used. Words like 'Liberal' and 'woke' need to be properly defined in the dictionary.   
 
4. Connect gun control to the promotion of beating deaths.  
 
5. Keep bringing up Dariano and Live Oak and say that it shows how the regime in California seeks a total extermination of American civilization.  
 
6. Bring up the practice of open defecation in California a lot and remind the American people of the Leftsts' desire to have the vulnerable poop in the streets for the pleasure of elites.  
 
7. Last but not least: talk about the SVB depositor bailout and how it was a huge subsidy to California Leftists at the expense of Conservatives because it cost the conservatives trillions of 2023 dollars worth of entrepreneurial opportunities, reduced inflation, and living costs. Talk about how Janet Yellen and Gavin Newsom 	pushed to SVB depositor bailout to stop you from competing with big tech and to try and force you to poop in the street for their own 	amusement. The SVB bailout stole the jobs and income of conservatives via opportunity costs to subsidize woke elites who want good and decent Americans tortured and/or killed.

Attorneys for Gov. Ron DeSantis, a state agency and his appointees to aÂ revamped boardÂ that governs Disney World are asking a judge to dismiss a federal lawsuit in which Disney claims its free speech rights were violated by the takeover of its governing district. The lawsuit states this happened in retaliation for Disney's opposition to the so-called Don't Say Gay legislation championed by the Florida governor.

Attorneys for DeSantis, the secretary of the Florida Department of Economic Opportunity and the DeSantis appointees to the Central Florida Tourism Oversight District filed motions Monday asking that Disney's lawsuit in federal court in Tallahassee either be dismissed, put on hold or that they be dropped as defendants.

&gt;**For this new indictment, we can all judge by ourselves the seriousness of the case.**  
  
&gt;**The main piece of evidence are two recordings of two phone calls that are available to be listened in their entirety on Internet. There is no ""portraying"" issue here. We can directly judge what he said with his own words.**  
  
&gt;**And the reality is that he shamelessly tried to meddle the elections results in Georgia and we would be outragedand rightly soif a Democrat had attempted anything remotely close like that.**  
  
&gt;[Screenshot of the comment and the conversation](https://i.imgur.com/zufhQjF.png).   
&gt;(NB: the comment was modified well before being banned, not after, and only for spelling reasons)  
  
I tried to appeal my ban but my appeal was instantly denied and no attempt to justify their decision was ever made. Here is the ""discussion"" I've had with the moderation team of r/Conservative:  
  
**Current-Values (me)**:  
  
&gt;WTF??? I am a lifelong conservative, I've never voted for anything else than conservative candidates in my entire life and my comment history on Reddit can fully back the fact that I am a genuine conservative.

&gt;Furthermore, the comment made here is not inflammatory or made in bad faith or whatsoever. For sure, I am not pro-Trump and I do criticize him quite a lot, but this r/Conservative is not supposed to be a pro-Trump only subreddit right?

&gt;Could you please review and cancel this ban?

&gt;Thanks,  
  
**r/Conservative moderation team**:

&gt;i have reviewed.. Appeal Denied  
  
**Current-Values (me)**: 
  
&gt;Ok... So would you care at least to give me a quick explanation on why do you think my ban is justified? What did I do wrong exactly?  
  
**r/Conservative moderation team**:  
  
&gt;Note from the moderators:

&gt;You have been banned for breaking the rules here: r7

&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/15rrkjn/-/jwb4akq/  
  
**Current-Values (me)**: 
  
&gt;I get that, but could you formulate one or two sentences to explain to me why my comment allegedly broke this rule?  
  
&gt;Something like: ""Your comment stated that [X] and we consider that [JUSTIFICATION]""  
  
&gt;If not blindly parroting pro-Trump talking points and narratives is worthy of a ban on r/Conservative, I can respect your position but you should make it clear.  
  
&gt;Banning genuine conservatives on a conservative subreddit for simply not being pro-Trump don't seem very fair and smart.  
  
**r/Conservative moderation team**:  
  
&gt;That's on you. Not up for debate.  
  
**Current-Values (me)**:    
  
&gt;I didn't ask for a ""debate"", merely a quick explanation. Just explain your reasoning, that's all I ask.  
  
&gt;I can see that you aren't willing to backpedal, so just say what you think was wrong with my comment and we are done.

"What does Conservative Mean? What are we Conserving?","2023-09-26",1695766715,"What does Conservative Mean? What are we Conserving?","The word conservative tends to get tossed around with abandon.  So, here's a post to reflect on my current understanding for what it means to be a political conservative today.  

To my mind, Political Conservatism has always been less of an agenda or a list of action items to be implemented than it is a state of mind that reflects a general attitude or temperament towards governance.  While the left is busy trying to transform mankind and society into their perfect world,  conservatism deals with the world as it is, not what anyone may want it to be at any given time. 

With that being said, here are nine basic tenets I believe carry the spirit of conservatism.  

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Individualism over Collectivism

  \* Individual identity takes prominence over any group identity.

  \*  People ought to be treated more as individuals than as members of a race, sex, ethnicity,  national origin, class status, organization or any other classification. 

 \*  People should not be treated as members of a collective as a means of achieving equality. 

 \*  Equality between any two individuals is generally meaningless, because it is meaningless to compare individuals.  Each individual is utterly unique in his/her own way. 

2. Respect for the Law of Unintended Consequences

 \* Every public effort has the potential to carry any number of unintended consequences.  Any time a governing body acts in the public interest, the governing body should seek input beforehand from as many affected parties as reasonably possible.  

 \* This rule eschews large-scale projects that try remake society on a grand scale. Respect for the law of unintended consequences does not necessarily preclude public endeavors to improve the public welfare, but it does encourage any such improvements to be accomplished through small pilot programs or by non-public voluntary participation.  

3. Right to Bear Arms 

 \* Individuals have a right to self defense against anyone attempting to do them bodily harm.  This right extends to protection of family and friends as well.  

4. Rule of Law

\*  We are to be governed by a nation of laws, not of men.  Laws are enacted by the appropriate legislative body, not to be amended retroactively.   

\* The jury system is the crown jewel of our system of justice.  

\* Justice should never be dependent on one man's intercession.  Every executive pardon should be viewed as a failure of justice. 

5. Right to Life

 \*  This is fundamental to respecting people as individuals.  It extends to issues such as abortion, euthanasia,  medical and life decisions.  

 \* One persons rights are aboslute so long as they do not infringe on another person's rights. 

6. Free Speech and Excercise of Religion

 \* Every individual retains a freedom of conscience and association.

7. Limited Government

 \* Government exists to serve the nation's common interests as a whole and should be limited to the bare essentials that affect those common interests.   Control ought to be decentralized to the most local authority as possible.  

8. Strong National Defense

 \*  A strong military is necesary to protect individuals against threats which they are unable to protect against themselves - either  individually or through local state militias or police.  

 \* A strong and capable militay helps uphold the international order and relations between nations.  

9. Free Trade

 \* The activity of commerce remains the single most unifying principles for society, where people who disagree on any number of issues can nevertheless voluntarily engage in commerce  and walk away having all benefited from the transaction.  It is essential this trade be free of politics.   As the basketball great Michael Jordan once said, ""Republicans buy sneakers too.""

 \* Transactions must be voluntary and free of state and corporate surveillance.  

 \*  International trade is a unifying force that brings nations into common cause by creating a mutual dependence of interests.  Free trade prevents wars.  Isolationism and any inhibition on commerce carry the danger of stoking more conflict.

 \* Taxation on transactions such as tariffs should be as minimal as possible to lessen the degree of state impedance on the wheels of commerce.

It means 61% of republican inclined voters in NH are NOT on board for another run.  They just have yet to consolidate behind an alternate candidate.

For a former president with TOTAL name recognition not to be anywhere near a clear majority is a disaster - especially if he goes into the general.

In another note, a MAGA candidate for a state NH House seat lost by 12 pts yesterday in a special election.  This was in a normally R+ district.  MAGA candidates are losing in ACTUAL races, despite Biden's unpopularity. (Of course, it may have been nice if Trump had taken some time to boost turnout in the district by posting about it a few times, but he didn't he was silent, because he doesn't care about any of these other races.)

Starting to pierce the veil of inevitablility. Talk show host and prominent Trump supporter is aghast at Trump's interview in which he called pro-Life gains in Fl, IA, OH, GA a ""terrible thing"".  She says will never support another president who won't defend the unborn.  

This is what happens when you have someone as your leader who is entirely transactional and doesn't have any core principles.  Everything, and I mean EVERYTHING becomes expendable.  


Why she calls DeSantis a ""CIA strawman"" is unknown to me. But it is beside the point. It would be one thing if Trump had called for a compromsed national solution, but he went beyond that. He called the efforts in the states, which the Supreme Court ruling on Dobbs was all about, a ""terrible thing"".

Ha! So, someone's trying to revise history on covid restrictions.  

Yesterday, Trump tried to slam Ron DeSantis' handling of covid to Hugh Hewitt, claiming ""he shut down Florida. It was tight as a drum. He had vax lines. He was vaxxing everything. Now, he talks about the vaccinations this and that.""

However, months after DeSantis had lifted nearly all the universal restrictions on September, 2020,  the Trump administration's Coronavirus Task Force sent a letter on Jan, 2021 warning him to reinstate those very restrictions and aggressively push the vaccine amidst another wave of the pandemic.  

Frankly, there were a lot of unknowns at the time, so I am inclined to forgive anyone instituting these restrictions, at least in the beginning.  But, Fauci was still on that task force then and had been given a medal of freedom award by Trump just that month.  

Trump would come off much better here if he would just adopt a little humility and just admit where things went wrong.  DeSantis is right in pointing out that we need to ensure this never happens again. This can only happen by being honest about what happened. 

Thankfully, at least in Florida, those restrictions were never reinstated.

"Ron DeSantis hits back at Trump, in wide-ranging interview with Dave Rubin","2023-09-07",1694096913,"Ron DeSantis hits back at Trump, in wide-ranging interview with Dave Rubin","So, the Governor is back on the campaign trail after taking time off to deal with Huriccane Idalia.  Here, he does  a hard-hitting and wide-ranging interview with podcaster Dave Rubin, where he hits back at a number of attacks from Team Trump.   

They discuss the  prior administration's handling of covid, perhaps Trump's greatest vulberability.  He further clarifies his position on Ukraine.  He also discusses the state of the race and gives his general strategy going forward in how he envisions winning the primary and general election. 

Admittedly, his position on Ukraine is still a bit weak.  His focus seems to somewhat mirror Trump's approach in using leverage to find a resolution and end the conflict.   While he seems a litte more sophisticated than Trump, he does not yet articulate the geo-political implicatons if Putin is rewarded for aggression.  However, he does leave himself considerable flexibility to act in ""the national interest"", whatever that may mean.   

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  


Highlights:

\--  He says again how he would have fired Dr. Fauci.  Trump had claimed earlier in the day that he was ""not allowed to fire him"".  DeSantis noted this was a departure from  his earlier claim that he did not fire him because the media and the dems wouldn't let him.  DeSantis insisted that is the ""price of leaderhip"".  He says that even if he could not fire him, Trump did not have to put him ""front and center"".   He blames Fauci for his lies about gain of function research. 

\-- He calls for a reckoning over how the government handled covid.   There needs to be a clearing out at the CDC, NIH and FDA.  They were wrong about masks, vaccines, school shutdowns, etc.  He says until there is accountability, they will keep trying it again.   He heralds Rep. Thomas Massie for being one of the few to push back on the $6 trillion worth of debt accumulated during the pandemic, more than any time in our nation's history.  

\-- He thinks that Trump hurts himself when he claims NY did better than FL in its handling of the pandemic.  He doesn't think Trump really believes it, since he is already on record saying he was one of the greatest governors in the country.   He says Trump only started criticizing two days before his re-election for political reasons. 

\-- He reminds viewers that Trump and his family moved to Florida under his governorship. 

\-- He reminds hardcore Trump supporters that he has done more for America First policies than anyone else:  banning sancturary cities in FL, fought against human smuggling, banned CCP buying property, shutdown Confucius institutes, protected 2nd Amendment with closed carry law, fought against Woke agenda, ESG, fired 2 Soros-backed prosecutors, upheld election integrity with an election crime task force. 

\-- He says Team Trump and the MSM are working together.  Trump campaign ""wined and dined"" with media elite before the first debate.  He claims the media want Trump for ratings and they know he is beatable in the general election. 

\-- He clarified his position on Ukraine War.  He repeats that Putin is ""not a good guy"".  He wants to end the war.  There should be ""no blank check"".  He calls for Europe to step up, and that we do should be in America's national interest.  He says we shouldn't be subcontracting out national interest to other countries. He specifically denounces the US for paying out salaries and pensions  for Ukrainian bureaucrats.  He says he would use leverage to end the conflict. He says US energy policy is benefiting Russia.  

\-- He calls for projecting hard power to the Indo-Pacific. China is a chief adversary. 

\-- A few words on the state of the race.  He says there is a higher volume of polls than usual this early in the race.  He says polls are expensive, claims groups with an agenda funding them. 

\-- Trump has 100% name ID, so it's understandable why he's in the lead.  He notes Trump soft's support.   He says he does not want to be a ""managed decline republican"".  He claims he is receiving a very postive reception in Iowa and New Hampshire.  He says he will outwork every other candidate, state by state. 

\-- He says the idea Trump is entitled to the nomination again is absurd.  He needs to defend his administration's record and explain how he thinks he is electable.  He says he is prepared to defend his record and tell his vision for how he intends to reverse America's decline.  

\-- He thinks the two political parties are reversing.  The Democrats are becoming the ""elite party"",  the Republicans are becoming a more working class ""salt of the earth"" party which stand for common sense things like a strong border, rule of law and an economy that is affordable.

"Proud Boys leader Joe Biggs sentenced to 17 years in January 6 case","2023-09-03",1693762358,"Proud Boys leader Joe Biggs sentenced to 17 years in January 6 case","It might be easy to dismiss J6 as a protest that got out of hand, and that was no doubt the case for the majority of people who traveled to Washington D.C. on that day.  However, others apparently expected or hoped for much more.

Gavin McGuiness, a comedian and reporter from Canada, was the original founding member of the Proud Boys.  Referring to themselves as ""proud boys"" was supposed to be the butt of an ongoing inside joke.  He intended it to be a largely civically-minded fraternal organization, but later disowned any connections to the group, as he saw it becoming much more politically activist.

Proud Boy member, Joe Biggs has now received one of the harshest sentences of 17 years so far for the part he played on J6.  It could have been a lot worse had he been given the 33 years the prosecution had recommended.  Leaving aside the wisdom of the sentence,  his actions need to be viewed in the larger context of how he may have encouraged the people around him. This is the main reason the judge cited for such a harsh sentence.

No doubt many protestors got caught up in the moment, and there are people in jail now for fairly innocuous crimes that are probably deserving of a pardon.

But just where did this protest go awry?  What turns a relatively peaceful assembly into a riot?   We can talk about Antifa-type or FBI infiltration, but it cannot be denied there were still apparently many  protestors  who were ripe for such an instigation.

This is where leadership matters.  It matters what the leaders of a movement say just as much as what it does.  One person may interpret what he hears quite differently than another.   We all heard Pres. Trump in his speech calling for the protestors to ""peacefully"" go over to the capitol, and that is how most of us took it.  On the other hand, he also continued to insist the election was stolen, had urged people to travel to DC, and had teased on twitter that it was going to be ""wild"".   (Despite most of his staff having testified they knew of no evidence at that time.)  It is therefore understandable how this may have raised expectations among some of his more fervent supporters.

Many of his supporters appreciate his authenticity, as he tends to go ""off script""  and not speak like a politician.   It is indeed refreshing, and it can appear as a relief from the doublespeak we are accustomed to hearing.  However, as we have seen, such unscripted comments can also come with devastating consequences, when they are said too casually without having thought through all the possible ramifications.

"What do y'all think, who did the best in the first GOP primary debate?","2023-08-24",1692849097,"What do y'all think, who did the best in the first GOP primary debate?","This is how I personally would rank the GOP candidates performances, from best at the top to worst at the bottom:

DeSantis - still my choice by far; he was calm, composed, said what needed to be said and didn't resort to name calling or petty insults to get his points across. I think he finished strong and was the clear winner.

Haley - extremely strong performance, in my opinion. I had essentially written her off; but she had a really good night and I'm wondering if she's a good VP option for DeSantis.

Pence - I still don't like him. But he also had a really good night, and if I didn't already dislike him, I may have actually started rooting for him. His dig at Vivek over the US not needing a rookie and it's not the time for ""on the job training"" was one of the highlights of the debate, for me.

Ramaswamy - ask I expected, he probably did more harm than good to his campaign. He came off as arrogant, clueless, and a hothead who thinks heavy handed authoritarian responses are the solutions to compensating for a lack of governing experience.

Christie - still a clown, that's why he got the UFO question.

Scott - really needed to stand out but just didn't.

Burgum - really needed to stand out but just didn't.

Hutchinson - really needed to stand out but just didn't.

Trump - skipped because he's a coward and cowards lose by de facto.
